# Security Policy

iCloud MCP reaches real personal iCloud accounts — mail, calendar, and
contacts. Security is the point of the design, not an afterthought. This
document explains how to report a vulnerability and what the server does and
does not guarantee.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.**

Report it privately through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab.
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**.
3. Describe the issue, the impact, and how to reproduce it.

> Maintainer setup: enable this once under **Settings → Code security and
> analysis → Private vulnerability reporting**.

You will get an acknowledgement, a fix or a decision with reasoning, and credit
in the advisory if you would like it. Please allow reasonable time to address
the issue before any public disclosure.

## Supported versions

This is a single-branch project. Security fixes are applied to the `main`
branch. There are no long-lived release branches to back-port to.

## What is a secret, and what is not

Several people can sign in. Each one brings their own Apple ID and their own
Apple app-specific password, and each one reaches only their own account. That
changes where the secrets are, so read this table before the rest.

| Secret | Where it lives | What it is for |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Each person's own app-specific password | Inside **their own grant's encrypted props**, and nowhere else | Proving that person to Apple, on their own calls only |
| `CONFIRM_SECRET` | Cloudflare Secrets | The HMAC key for calendar confirmation tokens |
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Cloudflare Secrets | The R2 S3 API token for presigned attachment uploads |
| `SAVE_LINK_SEAL_KEY` | Cloudflare Secrets | The key that seals each attachment download link, so a link cannot be read or forged |
| `AUTONOMY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Cloudflare Secrets | The autonomy client's secret. The token endpoint asks for it on every exchange, refresh and revocation, so a leaked stored autonomy key cannot be used on its own. The short-lived access token each rules run uses does work alone, until that run revokes it at the end |
| `AUTONOMY_SEAL_KEY` | Cloudflare Secrets | The key that seals each person's autonomy key, so reading every store opens nothing |
| Each person's autonomy key | Their own Durable Object, sealed with `AUTONOMY_SEAL_KEY` | Letting the rules job reach that person's mail with nobody present |

The server holds no account credential of its own. There is no shared login
password and no Apple identity in the Worker environment. Both existed before
the switch to per-person sign-in; neither does now.

The following are **not** secrets — they are opaque handles that grant nothing
on their own, and they live in configuration:

- The Cloudflare account id (`R2_ACCOUNT_ID`).
- KV namespace ids and the R2 bucket name.
- The deployed hostname.
- The allow-list seed — the owner's own address, held as a config value because
  it is read on every request and a config read is synchronous.

In the public repository these config values are placeholders; the real ones
live only in your git-ignored `wrangler.jsonc`.

## The security model

### The endpoint is authenticated

The Worker's entry point *is* the OAuth provider
(`@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider`). It owns routing, so the bearer-token
check runs before any project code. An unauthenticated request to `/mcp` is
refused before a tool is ever reached — a property covered directly by a test
using a canary tool.

The `/authorize` form asks for an Apple ID and an app-specific password. It
checks the address against a two-source allow list, proves the credential
against Apple with exactly **one** IMAP login, and only redirects to an
allowlisted origin (Claude/loopback) or an exact configured ChatGPT callback
URI. ChatGPT redirects require HTTPS on exactly `chatgpt.com`; lookalike hosts,
credentials, queries and fragments are refused. Every redirect must also match
the client registration. S256 PKCE remains required for public clients;
confidential clients retain the provider's existing authentication policy.

Every refusal is held to a floor of about three seconds, counted from the first
statement of the request. That is deliberate: a wrong password, an address that
is not on the list, and a badly-shaped value all take the same time and give the
same message, so a stopwatch cannot tell them apart and cannot be used to learn
who is on the list.

Three limiter layers sit under that form:

| Layer | What it counts | Why |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| The time floor | Nothing — it holds every failing answer open for the same span | It needs no durable counter, so it still works when a store write fails |
| A per-source connection counter | Connections from one source over a one-minute window | Blunts a flood before it reaches the credential path |
| A per-person failure counter | Five failed attempts in an hour, keyed by the person | Stops a guessing run against one named address |

### Who can sign in

Two sources, asked in order:

1. **The seed** — the owner's own address, a config value, read on **every**
   request.
2. **The store** — a KV document, `allow-list:v1`, holding everyone else, read
   **only at sign-in**.

They are split because the two readers ask different questions. The per-request
door has to answer synchronously; a store read is an `await`. Keeping the
owner's own address in the config also means a bad store write can never lock
the owner out of their own server.

An **absent, empty or malformed** document means nobody beyond the seed. Never
everybody. The server refuses rather than guessing. Exactly one value opens it
to anyone, and that value is the literal `["*"]`.

### Removing someone, and what it costs

**It is two steps, and the second one is not optional.**

1. Take the address out of `allow-list:v1`. No deploy is needed; the store is
   read fresh at every sign-in, so the next one they attempt is refused.
2. Revoke their grants — `node scripts/grants.mjs revoke --address … --yes`.

   Revoking their grants also ends autonomy: the autonomy sign-in is one of
   their grants, and it also ends on its own, within a day, once they hold no
   ordinary sign-in. Taking them off the list alone stops autonomy from
   running, but the key stays until their grants are revoked.

Here is why step 1 alone is not enough, stated rather than left to be
discovered.

1. **The per-request door reads the seed only.** It cannot read the store,
   because a store read is an `await` and the door has a tested contract that it
   never awaits.
2. **So a well-shaped grant carrying an address the seed does not name is still
   served.** The grant is itself the evidence that a login passed the store
   check when it was minted.
3. **Therefore taking someone off the list ends their *next* sign-in.** It does
   not end the session they already have.
4. **Ending a live session needs the revoke.** Allow about a minute for the
   store to settle; the script re-lists after deleting and exits non-zero if
   anything is left.
5. **The honest sentence, and it belongs before the invitation rather than
   after:** when you add someone, you are handing out access that survives your
   removing them from the list, until you also revoke.

This is an accepted weakening, recorded here with its cost, because the
alternative — making the per-request door await a store read — is a change to
the one property that keeps the door cheap and testable.

### Where a credential lives

- Only in the grant's encrypted props, and — once decrypted for a request — in a
  `WeakMap` that is private to one module and keyed by the principal object
  itself. It dies with the principal.
- Credentials are consumed by write-only helpers that return nothing, so no
  object holding a password is ever built to be serialized.
- There are **no logging calls anywhere in `src/`**. IMAP's `LOGIN` carries the
  password inline in the command stream, so a single "log the command I'm
  sending" line would leak it — the rule is therefore absolute, and enforced by
  a scanner on every commit.
- Errors are mapped to a fixed, small vocabulary by dispatching on the error
  *type*. No error message echoes a caught value's text, and no diagnostic
  field repeats the last command sent.
- For every person who has signed in since autonomy was set up, one more thing:
  a sealed refresh token in their own Durable Object. It opens that person's
  autonomy sign-in and nothing else. It is sealed with a Worker secret, so
  reading every store opens nothing. It lasts as long as that person's ordinary
  connection. See "Autonomy (inherent)" below.

### Per-user scoping

Every store key that holds one person's data carries that person's own derived
id, with nothing between the key prefix and the id. That is enforced by a scan
rule, not by care: a key with no user segment is a key any signed-in caller
could name.

One store is an exception, on purpose. The spent mark for an attachment save
link is keyed by a hash of the link, because the download has no signed-in
person. The mark holds nothing about the person, and one module may read it.

So one person's cache, staging objects and counters cannot be reached through
another person's session.

### Recall keeps a searchable copy of your recent mail

Recall is **off by default**. Only the exact config value `RECALL_ENABLED="true"`
enables it. With it off, ordinary mail operations do not invoke Workers AI or
Vectorize and do not index mail; the recall and backfill tools are absent.
The sign-in page states whether indexing is enabled before anyone types anything.
The default deployment needs neither an AI binding nor a Vectorize index.

When enabled, recall indexes recent mail for each signed-in person so the
assistant can find a message by its meaning. The rest of this section describes
that optional mode. Turning it off stops indexing/search, but does not erase
previously stored data. Keep the bindings for deletion-only expiry/revocation
cleanup until the existing index has been removed.

**What is kept.** For each message in the inbox and the archive folder from the
last 90 days: its subject line, and a numeric fingerprint made from the subject,
the sender's name and the first lines of the body. The message text itself is
never kept. The text used to make the fingerprint is sent to the embedding
Cloudflare Workers AI model, and then thrown away. The vector store is
Cloudflare Vectorize. Ordinary requested mail, calendar and contact content is
still returned to the connected assistant when recall is disabled.

**Where.** In the person's own partition of the vector store, and in a ledger
in their own Durable Object. Every read and write of the index is scoped to the
signed-in person, and only that person can search it.

**How long.** Each entry expires 90 days after its message's date.

**How it leaves.**

- Mail deleted in iCloud leaves the index on the next sync of its folder, or the
  first time a recall result fails to open, whichever comes first.
- Everything is deleted within a day of the person's access ending. Access ends
  when the owner revokes it, or when the person's last connection ends. Removing
  someone is still the two steps "Removing someone" describes above; the index
  follows the second one.

**How the index is built.** Only from calls made through the person's own
sign-in. Never from anything this server does on its own. Ordinary mail tool
calls build it one page of 25 messages at a time, at most one page a minute.
The person can also ask Claude to fill it faster with `mail_recall_backfill`.
Each call reads up to 10 pages, one after another, and only from a folder that
is still being built, the first time or again after a reset. Every page runs
under the same per-person connection lease every mail tool takes, and its
sessions run one after another. So building the index does not open a second
connection to iCloud at the same time as a tool call. One rare case remains.
An ordinary page can open up to three sessions, and a very slow one can
outlast its 30-second lease, so another call may connect before it closes. A
backfill page refuses to start a session that could do that.

**The ceilings.** Each person holds at most 10,000 entries. Ordinary calls read
at most 200 pages for one person in one day. Backfill calls do not count toward
that. They read at most 400 pages for one person in one day, which is enough to
fill 10,000 entries once. These bound what is kept and what it costs.

These numbers are constants in `src/recall/retention.ts`, `src/recall/sync.ts`
and `src/agent/recall-ledger.ts`, and a check keeps this section equal to them.

### Autonomy (inherent)

Autonomy is inherent. Every sign-in also makes a second sign-in, just for
autonomy. There is no opt-in and no switch. The sign-in page says so, above the
sign-in fields, before the person signs in.

**What is kept.** The refresh token of that second sign-in, sealed, in the
person's own Durable Object. It is sealed with a Worker secret, and the seal is
tied to that person, so it opens only in their own object. The Apple password is
stored nowhere new: it sits inside the autonomy sign-in's locked props, the same
as every other sign-in's.

**What it does.** One check right after sign-in that the key works. That check
asks only which account the key belongs to, and reads no mail. After that, only
what the person's own rules say, and only flag a message or put a draft reply in
the Drafts folder. It never sends mail. With no rules, it does nothing.

**How long.** Exactly as long as the person's ordinary connection. There is no
timer. The next interactive sign-in makes a new key and revokes the old one. A
Claude app refreshing its own token makes nothing.

**How it ends.**

- The person's last ordinary sign-in is revoked or removed. The key ends within
  a day, and at its next use at the latest.
- The owner revokes the autonomy grant.
- Taking the person off the allow list stops every use before the key is read.
  It does not delete the key: a store error looks the same as a removal, and
  deleting on an error would end everyone's key at once.
- The person deletes their app-specific password at account.apple.com.

**What the seal protects, and what it does not.** Someone who can only read this
server's storage gets nothing, because the secret that opens the seal is in no
store. Someone who can run code in this Worker gets every signed-in person's key
at once, and can use it for anything this server's tools can do. The limit to
flag and draft holds for this server's own code, not for an attacker's.

That is the blast radius: **every signed-in account**, not only people who chose
it. Before autonomy, the same attacker reached each person only when that person
next signed in or used the server. The owner accepted this on 2026-09-27.

**If you think the server was compromised, every signed-in person should delete
their app-specific password at account.apple.com.** Nothing on a timer protects
the password: the key has no expiry, and an app-specific password opens the
whole mail account.

### Autonomous rules

- What the job can do: flag a message, and place a draft reply to its sender.
  Nothing else, enforced by the scan.
- When it runs: every 15 minutes, only for a person who has at least one rule
  and holds an autonomy key. Every signed-in person holds a key (autonomy is
  inherent), so in practice: only for people with rules. With no rules it does
  nothing, and makes no iCloud connection.
- What it reads: the sender and subject of new inbox mail, and whether it came
  from a mailing list. The job never reads a body. When it places a reply, the
  reply tool reads that one message to thread and quote the reply, as it does
  for any reply.
- What a draft holds: a reply to the matching message. The rule's text, "Re: "
  and the original subject, the threading headers, and the original, quoted.
  The one recipient is the message's From address. Never Reply-To, Sender,
  anyone copied or an address in the text. No reply to the account's own
  address, to mailing-list mail, or when the From line has no usable address.
- Limits: 10 flags and 3 replies a run, 10 replies a day, 20 rules. A reply is
  two iCloud sessions.
- If Apple twice refuses the password itself, the two refusals at least one
  wake apart, the job drops that person's key. Their next sign-in makes a new
  one, and their rules run again. An iCloud outage, a server error, or a
  refusal that does not name the password never counts: the job waits longer
  between tries instead, up to a day, and makes no sign-in attempt while it
  waits.
- When a person holds no sign-in of any kind, seen on two checks a day apart,
  their rules, activity and job state are deleted.
- How to stop it: the person removes every rule. The owner revokes the person's
  key or access, or takes them off the allow list.
- Where to see it: `rules_list` for the person; `grants.mjs list` for the owner
  (next wake, failures, for each person with rules).
- Known and accepted: a stranger can make a rule fire by writing a matching
  sender and subject. The result is the user's own flag, or a draft reply in the
  user's words to the address the stranger put in From. From can be forged, so
  that reply may be addressed to someone who did not write the message, and it
  quotes whatever the message said. The person sees both before sending. A
  stranger can also leave off the mailing-list headers to get a reply. A flood
  spends the day's replies.

### The dead-password pause

**What it is.** When Apple itself refuses the password saved in a grant, a
marker goes into the store for that person, and for fifteen minutes the server
refuses their calls before anything reaches Apple. Apple's own lockout
threshold is unpublished, and walking into it locks the person out of their own
mail in Mail.app on their own devices. A revoked or rotated app-specific
password would otherwise turn every tool call into a doomed login.

**What it is not.** It is not a lockout of this server, and it is not something
the sign-in page can start. The page never sets the marker — that asymmetry is
what stops a stranger who knows a listed address from pausing that person's
working apps.

**Two tools deliberately answer through it**: `mail_imap_diagnose` and
`dav_diagnose` (owner decision, 2026-09-22). The tool somebody runs to find out
*why* has to stay answerable while a pause is in force — including a pause it
started itself. `account_whoami` stays subject to the pause, and the exemption
is granted by an explicit registration rather than assumed.

A successful sign-in clears the marker, so someone who has just made a fresh
app-specific password does not wait out the fifteen minutes and conclude the fix
did not work.

### The assistant cannot send mail

There is no SMTP path and no mail-sending library. The assistant writes drafts
into the iCloud Drafts folder via IMAP `APPEND`, and composes no other mail. A
human reviews every draft and sends it. This is the backstop against
prompt-injected content in an email reaching an outbound message under your
name. The draft write is built in exactly one module, enforced as a count (zero
writers is as much a violation as two).

### Reading mail does not change it

Every read opens its mailbox **read-only**, and every fetch uses the peeking
form, so the assistant reading your mail never sets the seen flag. Read status
stays a field *you* control. It changes only when you ask the assistant to mark
a message read or unread, one message at a time.
Flagging is one message at a time too. You can ask for it, and a rule you added
can also set the flag on its own (see "Autonomous rules"). A rule never clears a
flag and never changes read status.

### Saving an attachment to your own computer

`mail_save_attachment` saves attachments from one message to a folder on your own computer, from
Claude Cowork. The server copies each file into its storage, under your own prefix, and gives back a
download link. Cowork downloads the link with the shell of your local session, into the folder you
connected, and checks the file's SHA-256.

- A link names one copy. It stops working five minutes after it is made.
- A link works once in practice. The first download marks it spent before it sends a byte, and
  deletes the copy when it ends. A second download from the same place, or after the first has
  finished, is refused. Opening the link in a browser spends it too, and so does a download that
  breaks part-way. Then ask Claude for a new link. The mark takes time to reach every Cloudflare
  location, so two downloads from two different places at almost the same moment can both succeed.
- A link is sealed with a Worker secret, `SAVE_LINK_SEAL_KEY`. It carries whose copy it is, its name,
  its expiry and its size, and nobody can read them or make a link without that secret.
- The download deletes the copy. An unused copy is deleted at your next save, when anyone tries its
  dead link, or by the bucket's daily sweep within two days.
- Until it is used or expires, the link is a password for one file. It appears in your conversation,
  and Cloudflare's request log keeps every URL for seven days. By then the link is dead. The URL
  shows no user id.
- The download needs no sign-in, reads no mail and opens no mail connection. It serves only a copy the
  tool made. Bad links all get the same empty answer, and requests are braked per address.
- The file is always sent as a download, never shown as a page. It came from a stranger, and the
  tool's answer says not to open it.
- macOS does not mark the saved file as downloaded from the internet, so it gives no warning when you
  open it. Treat it like any attachment from a stranger.
- Only you, asking in the moment, can save. The rules job cannot call this tool.
- One file can be up to about 15 MB. iCloud refuses messages over 20 MB, so no real attachment is
  larger.

### Moving mail is previewed, and nothing is removed for good

Moving mail to another folder, to the archive folder or to Trash **writes
nothing on the first call**. It returns a preview. The move happens only when
`mail_commit` replays the preview's confirmation unchanged, and only if the
messages have not changed since. Each message is copied first. The original is
removed only after iCloud proves where the copy landed, so a failure part-way
leaves a message in both folders, never in neither. Nothing removes mail for
good or empties Trash, and a message in Trash can be moved back. The list of
messages is always the one you picked, never one built from a search or from
what a message says.

Deleting a draft is the same move, for one draft, to Trash. It acts only on a
draft in the drafts folder, exactly as the preview showed it. It does not check
who wrote the draft.

### Destructive calendar actions are gated

Creating an event with attendees, updating an event, and deleting an event all
**write nothing on the first call**. They return a preview plus a signed,
single-use, short-lived confirmation token. The change is applied only when
`calendar_commit` replays that token and the exact previewed change. The token
is HMAC-signed with `CONFIRM_SECRET`, carries a unique id spent once in KV, and
is bound to a hash of the change so it cannot be altered before commit. This
ensures you see *who* will be notified and *what* will change before anything
irreversible happens.

### Untrusted content is fenced

Mail bodies, event titles, contact fields, and calendar names are data from the
outside world. Tool results wrap them in an explicit untrusted-content fence
(a notice plus a nonce-delimited block) so the assistant is told to treat them
as content to report, never as instructions to follow. Attendee lists for any
write are always caller-supplied — never derived from content the server read.

### One connection at a time

IMAP sessions are opened, used, and closed within a single request. There is no
connection pooling and no fan-out. One request can open several sessions one
after another, never two at once: a mail tool's own, then the recall step that
may follow it, or the pages of one backfill call. This is enforced structurally
(one socket importer, two session orchestrators — read and mutating — over one
private core and one request gate, no concurrent combinator around any of them).

Across requests, each person's Durable Object holds a lease. A mail call must
take it before it connects. A second call that finds it held is refused at
once, not queued, and the lease ends on its own after 30 seconds. Together
these keep the server from exhausting iCloud's per-account connection ceiling
and locking you out of your own mail.

### No Zero Trust portal in front of this server

This server does not sit behind a Cloudflare Zero Trust MCP portal, and it is
not going to. That is a decision with a reason, not a gap nobody has got round
to yet.

The reason is one setting. Cloudflare's guidance for an unattended caller — a
service token — tells you to turn the portal's per-user authentication off. With
it off, every caller through the portal shares one identity: whichever account
authenticated the server first. This server is built on the opposite of that. A
separate Apple credential per person, a separate cache, separate counters, a
separate everything — and that one setting would collapse all of it. Nothing in
this repository could tell. It is account configuration, invisible to the test
suite, the commit scan and the pre-commit hook. A related step gets there by
another route: configuring this server's own OAuth provider as the access layer
is the documented remedy for a portal being bypassable by URL, and it replaces
this server's sign-in outright, ending per-user Apple grants.

So the constraints are written here as standing refusals, before any portal
exists. A future session reading the vendor's documentation will find the
recommended-but-wrong path; it should find these first.

- **Per-user authentication must be Enabled.** With it off there is one identity,
  and the multi-user model is gone.
- **No service token, ever**, and no autonomous caller routed through a portal.
- **No tool aliases and no description overrides.** Tool names here carry
  promises a model reasons from, and tool descriptions carry the
  untrusted-content warnings. A dashboard can rewrite both with no diff, no
  review and no commit-time scan.
- **A portal is never the gate.** The allow list is, and always was. Cloudflare's
  own documentation concedes that a user blocked by an access policy can still
  reach the server directly by its URL.

What would have to change for this to be worth revisiting is the identity model
itself. A portal is the right answer when it supplies something missing — when
the server behind it has no authentication of its own, or when every caller
legitimately is the same person. Neither is true here. It was not dropped for
cost: Zero Trust is already in use on this account and there is no per-seat
charge at this size. It was not dropped for difficulty: no code change was
needed. And it was not dropped because a trial failed — whether a portal's
sign-in composes with this server's own was never tested, and that question is
still open for anyone who revisits this.

## Scope for reports

**In scope:** authentication or authorization bypass; one person reaching
another person's account, cache, staged files, counters, recall index or
autonomy key; credential exposure in logs, responses, or errors; a path that
sends mail, or makes a destructive change without its preview/commit gate; a
way to make the server mark mail read without being asked; the rules job doing
anything beyond flagging a message and placing a draft reply; injection that
escapes the untrusted-content fence into tool-calling behavior; the transport
safety rules being circumventable.

**Out of scope:** anything requiring your Cloudflare account or Apple
credentials to already be compromised; the deliberate design decisions above
(no sending, the rules job and the risks "Autonomous rules" accepts, no Zero
Trust portal in front of the endpoint, and the two-step removal whose cost is
stated above); and issues in third-party
dependencies that should be reported upstream
(tell us anyway if they affect this server).
