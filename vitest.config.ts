// Test wiring (D-03, D-09): tests execute inside the real workerd runtime,

// The pool is registered as a Vite *plugin*. The rationale for this import
// shape — and for the earlier API it replaces — is recorded in
// .planning/phases/01-foundation-imap-connectivity-proof/01-01-SUMMARY.md
// rather than here, because this file is grepped for the superseded name.
//
// Two projects, because this suite has two genuinely different needs and
// Vitest 4 does not inherit root plugins into inline projects (that changes in
// 5, so the plugin is declared inside the project that needs it rather than at
// the root where it would silently apply to neither):
//
//   workers — everything that exercises Worker behaviour. Real workerd.
//   static  — the forbidden-token scan, which reads the repository off disk.
//             A Workers isolate has no filesystem, so this cannot run in the
//             pool: `readFileSync` there resolves against a virtual filesystem
//             holding only the bundle, and every repo path is a miss.
//
// The split is deliberately narrow. Anything that is not filesystem-bound
// belongs in the workers project, where the runtime is the real one.
