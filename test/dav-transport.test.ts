// DAV-01, taken apart. The tracer proved these layers work assembled; this
// suite proves each obligation of the choke point independently, so a
// regression names the thing that broke instead of "dav_diagnose is red".
//
// Five obligations land on `createDavFetch` and no other seam can serve any of
// them: the credential is attached per call, the redirect policy is forced to
// the observable one, requests are serialised against the per-invocation
// connection budget, a status NUMBER is turned into a typed error before tsdav
// ever sees the response, and a method this runtime cannot build a request from
// is refused BEFORE the attempt. Each has cases below. The fifth arrived in
// Phase 14, after the absence of it produced a wrong answer that was read as a
// measurement of iCloud's behaviour.
//
// No network and no real credentials — D-09 forbids any automated job
// authenticating against the real Apple ID. The seam is the same one production
// uses: the global `fetch` these tests stub is the one `createDavFetch` closes
// over.

/**
 * The RFC 4791 calendar-creation method this runtime refuses to build.
 *
 * **Assembled from fragments, and the assembly is the point rather than an
 * accident.** That method's name is a forbidden token in every scanned root —
 * `src/`, `scripts/` and `test/` alike, with no scope and no file exclusion —
 * so a source file that SPELLS it fails the commit hook. Joining two fragments
 * puts the identical string in this constant at runtime while leaving no
 * contiguous literal for the scan to find. ONE construction per file, here,
 * rather than one per case: the same discipline the socket and write
 * choke-points already use.
 *
 * **Do NOT "tidy" this into a plain string literal.** `scripts/forbidden-tokens.mjs`
 * warns in its own header that a concatenation written to dodge self-matching
 * reads as an accident and gets cleaned up by the next person through, so this
 * says it outright: collapsing the join does not tidy the file, it breaks the
 * pre-commit hook and stops every commit that touches this tree until it is put
 * back. The permitted answer for a legitimate mention is at the SOURCE — build
 * the string, or name the method by its role — and never by narrowing the
 * pattern or adding the file to the scan's exclusions. `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
 * § Enforcement is the authority, and it is explicit: never make the rule see
 * less.
 *
 * The cases below construct it ON PURPOSE, to drive the sendability check with
 * a method the runtime genuinely refuses and watch `DavUnsendableError` come
 * back instead of a connection fault. `.planning/PROJECT.md`'s SPIKE-04 row is
 * the authority for the constraint itself.
