// The server-level instructions string, and the gate that keeps it from rotting.
//
// **Two claims, and they are not the same claim.**
//
// The first is DELIVERY: the string reaches a client. A test asserting only that
// `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS` is a non-empty constant would pass just as happily on a
// server that never passes it to the SDK, which is precisely the state this file
// was written to leave behind -- the text existed nowhere, and every boundary was
// inferred from tool names. So the assertion is made on the wire: a real server
// from the real per-request factory, connected to a transport, answering a real
// `initialize`, and the `instructions` field of THAT result compared
// byte-for-byte against the exported constant.
//
// The second is FRESHNESS: the text still describes the tools that exist. This
// is the claim with a short shelf life. Nine queued seeds (contact writes, RSVP,
// draft editing, calendar management, mail triage, reminders) each add or change
// a tool, and each of them makes at least one sentence in that string wrong --
// "there is no contact write", "no mail triage", "read-only apart from drafts".
// Nothing about adding a tool would fail today, so the drift would be silent and
// the string would end up describing a server that no longer exists. The pinned
// set below is what turns that into a forced edit.
//
// **Why the tool set is derived from the RUNNING server rather than from source
// text.** The repository already trusts both idioms. `test/dav-tools.test.ts`
// reads `src/mcp/tools/calendar.ts` as text via a `?raw` import and slices
// registrations out of it; `test/dav-diagnose.test.ts` builds the real factory
// and exercises what it produced. This file takes the second, because the
// question here is what a CLIENT is told, and `tools/list` is literally that
// answer. A source-text count would also miss a tool registered through a helper
// or a loop -- an addition shaped exactly like the ones the seeds queue up.
//
// (The README's "24 tools in four groups" was, until this file, counted by hand
// and gated by nothing at all. It is gated here too, from the same live count,
// since it rots on exactly the same event.)

 * what is absent ("no contact write", "no mail triage", "read-only apart from

 * at least invites a question.
 *
 * Sorted, so the assertion is about membership and not about registration order.
