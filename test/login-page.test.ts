// What the person at the keyboard is actually shown, and what rides back with
// it on every other answer this surface can give.
//
// **This file and `test/authorize-login.test.ts` prove different things and the
// difference is worth stating.** That file is about FLOW: who is refused, in
// what order, how many times the login proof was called, and what the ceremony
// was completed with. It can watch the whole path and still not notice that the
// page forgot to explain what an app-specific password is, or that a submitted
// password came back in the markup, or that the method-not-allowed answer can
// be framed. This file is about the RESPONSE SURFACE — the bytes, the headers
// and the attributes — and it asserts them against the constants the handler
// actually serves rather than against retyped copies that could drift.
//
// Three tables, and each one is named so the phase's validation map can find
// it. Those commands filter on `explainer`, `never echoed` and `headers`, and a
// name filter that matches nothing passes SILENTLY — which would leave three
// requirement rows looking covered while measuring nothing. If a table is
// renamed, the filter in `11-VALIDATION.md` has to be renamed with it.
//
// Two shapes, the same two the consent suite uses. A recording stub provider
// for everything that is about what a single response looks like, because that
// needs no registered client and no real namespace. The real entry — over the
// injected login proof, because D-09 forbids any automated login to a real
// Apple ID — for the one case that has to complete the whole ceremony, which is
// the only way to see the redirect that carries the authorization code.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The one claim in this contract that a HUMAN confirms, not this file.
//
// No copy line may force horizontal scrolling at 320px width.
//
// The longest unbreakable token USED to be the example app-specific password
// in the password field's help text, `abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop`. That example is
// gone: spike S5 was declined on 2026-09-20, the handler stopped transforming
// the submitted value, and the copy now tells the reader to paste it exactly as
// Apple showed it rather than naming a shape the project cannot stand behind.
//
// So the risk this backstop covers went DOWN rather than away. The longest
// remaining token on the page is a rendered destination origin, which already
// has its own `overflow-wrap` treatment and its own row in the UI spec. The
// note is kept rather than deleted because the claim is still the claim — no
// copy line may force horizontal scrolling — and because a backstop that
// silently loses its worst case looks exactly like one that was never needed.
//
// Nothing here can check that. This project has no browser in its test
// environment — the suite runs inside the workers runtime, which lays nothing
// out and measures nothing — so a test asserting it would be asserting the
// presence of a CSS declaration, not the behaviour the claim is about. It is
// recorded as a backstop in `11-VALIDATION.md` and confirmed by eye at 320px.
