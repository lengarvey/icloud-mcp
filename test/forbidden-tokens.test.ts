  // rather than for a new request shape — it ends in `davRequest`, already on the
  // library half below, so it matched BY ACCIDENT before it was written down, and
  // the accident evaporates the first time its body is refactored.
  //
  // The shape it ships is the one this rule was written for outright: a LOOP over
  // four resources issuing one depth-0 `DAV:propname` PROPFIND apiece, which is
  // exactly where a combinator gets written because that is what makes four round
  // trips fast — and the concurrent version returns the same four name lists, so

  // it easy to justify speeding up, on `readCollectionState`'s own terms: it
  // writes nothing, so a fan-out costs no calendar state — but four round trips
  // plus discovery and the home listing is already most of one invocation's
  // budget, and iCloud's own per-account ceiling is lower, undocumented and
  // deliberately unmeasured.
  //
  // `propertyNamesInBody` is deliberately NOT here, for the reason every pure
  // reader is left off: it reads element names out of the raw multistatus BODY the
  // probe already holds and issues no request. It named `isDefaultCalendar` as its
  // precedent until 2026-09-26, when CALM-07's withdrawal deleted that function.
  // It carries no manifest disposition either, and that is correct rather than an
  // omission — it is module-private, and the manifest collects `export function`
  // declarations.
  //
  // It reads the BODY rather than the library's parse because that parse could
  // not answer the question at all — measured live on 2026-09-25, and recorded in
  // its own section in `src/dav/diagnose.ts`. The swap changes nothing here: a
  // reader of a string issues no more requests than a reader of an object.
  //
  // Prefix-shadow check RUN against the whole shipped alternation rather than
  // eyeballed: it neither contains nor is contained by any entry.
  // `runCollectionWriteProbe`, `runTaskCollectionProbe` and
  // `runDavDiagnosticOutcome` are the near misses and all three diverge at the
  // fourth character (`runP` / `runC` / `runT` / `runD`), and `propfind` is not
  // contiguous inside it because the capitalisation differs. So its per-name loop
  // below can genuinely fail and the recorded prefix-shadow exception list stays
  // at two.
  "runPropertyNameProbe",
  // Phase 16 (CONW-01). `createContact` is the CardDAV service write: one card
  // per request, conditional on `If-None-Match`, and irreversible in the sense
  // the rule's WRITE paragraph means — "add all of these people" is one
  // sentence, and a half-completed fan-out over it leaves an address book
  // holding some of a list nobody can name.
  //
  // `buildContactCreatePreview` and `applyContactCommit` are the composites, on
  // the same terms as phase 5's eight: each ends in one or more of the names
  // above, so each was covered only BY ACCIDENT, and a body is a refactor away
  // from not doing that.
  //
  // No entry here is a prefix or a substring of any of the three, and none of

  // contiguous inside `buildContactCreatePreview`. So all three per-name loops
  // below can genuinely fail, and the `getEventWithEtag` exception list stays at
  // one — which the exception case itself proves rather than takes on trust.
  //
  // `planContactCreateTarget` and `contactUidFromObjectUrl` are deliberately NOT
  // here, on the precedent `planCreateTarget` set at WINDOWS entry 60: both are
  // synchronous, issue no request, and this rule's subject is round trips
  // against one account, so listing a pure function would misstate what it bans.
  // Both carry a WRITTEN disposition in the DAV write manifest instead.
  "createContact",
  "buildContactCreatePreview",
  "applyContactCommit",
  // Phase 16 (CONW-05). The duplicate scan, and the case the rule's own text
  // describes most directly: two probes over one address book is exactly the
  // loop a combinator gets wrapped around, because that is what makes two round
  // trips fast — and the concurrent version returns the same candidates, so
  // nothing about the answer reveals it.
  //
  // It needs no new entry on `DAV_FAN_OUT_LIBRARY`: every request it issues is
  // already named there — `addressBookQuery` for the filtered probe, `propfind`
  // for the enumeration and `addressBookMultiGet` for the bulk read. Read from
  // the pattern rather than assumed.
  //
  // `duplicateFilter` is deliberately NOT here, on the precedent
  // `planContactCreateTarget` set one entry up: it assembles a report body and
  // issues no request, so listing it would misstate what this rule bans. It
  // carries a WRITTEN disposition in the DAV write manifest instead.
  //
  // No entry here is a prefix or a substring of it, and it contains none:
  // `findFreeSlots` shares only `find`, and `getContact` and `createContact` are
  // not contiguous inside it. So its per-name loop below can genuinely fail, and
  // the `getEventWithEtag` exception list stays at one.
  "findDuplicateCandidates",
  // Phase 16 (CONW-02, CONW-06). The two halves of a conditional update: the read
  // that brings back the version stamp, and the overwrite that is conditional on
  // it. Both are named for the reason the WRITE paragraph of the rule's own text
  // gives, and the read is named because it ends in a request too — a fan-out over
  // reads-with-a-version is a fan-out over multi-gets.
  //
  // `getContactWithEtag` JOINS the exception list below rather than adding a
  // per-name loop with teeth: `getContact` precedes it in the alternation and is a
  // prefix of it, so it matched before it was written down, exactly as
  // `getEventWithEtag` does on the calendar tree. That is recorded there rather
  // than repaired here, because the repair — a trailing word boundary on the
  // group — would make the rule match strictly LESS than it does today.
  //
  // `updateContact` has no such defect: no entry is a prefix or a substring of it
  // and it contains none. `getContact` and `createContact` are not contiguous
  // inside it, and `updateEvent` shares only `update`. So its loop can genuinely
  // fail, and the exception list grows by exactly one rather than two.
  "getContactWithEtag",
  "updateContact",
  // Phase 16 (CONW-02). The update PREVIEW composite, and the last name this
  // phase adds. It is here on the COMPOSITE paragraph's terms and it is the
  // strongest instance of them: it ends in TWO guarded names rather than one —
  // `getContactWithEtag` for the card and `findDuplicateCandidates` for the scan —
  // so "covered by accident" is twice as easy to arrive at, and a body that
  // stopped calling either would still match through the other while the
  // guarantee quietly rested on whichever survived the refactor.
  //
  // Its two awaits are serial on purpose and the ORDER is load-bearing rather
  // than incidental: the card is read first so the scan can be told which card to
  // leave out of its own answer. A combinator here would not merely spend two
  // connections at once, it would ask the scan to exclude a url nobody had read
  // yet.
  //
  // No entry here is a prefix or a substring of it and it contains none:
  // `updateContact` shares only the word `update` and not contiguously — this
  // name spells `ContactUpdate` — `getContact` and `createContact` are not
  // contiguous inside it, and neither `buildPreview`, `buildCreatePreview` nor
  // `buildContactCreatePreview` is. So its per-name loop below can genuinely fail
  // and the recorded exception list stays at two.
  "buildContactUpdatePreview",
  // Phase 17 (CALM-04). The collection create, and the first entry on this list
  // whose SUBJECT is a calendar rather than something inside one.
  //
  // The temptation this phase introduces has a shape the earlier ones did not.
  // An account holds nine calendars; once one of them can be made, renamed or
  // removed by name, "tidy up my calendars" is one sentence that means N of
  // them — and the first thing anybody reaching for that writes is a
  // combinator, because that is what makes N round trips fast. It is also the
  // WRITE paragraph's sharper case one level up: a half-completed fan-out over
  // collections leaves whole calendars nobody chose, and on the rename and
  // delete that follow in 17-04 and 17-06, some of them gone.
  //
  // It needs no new entry on `DAV_FAN_OUT_LIBRARY`: the raw request helper this
  // create assembles its extended `MKCOL` through is already named there, added
  // in phase 14. Read from the pattern rather than assumed.
  //
  // `calendarColorForWire` is deliberately NOT here, on the precedent
  // `planCreateTarget` set at WINDOWS entry 60 and `duplicateFilter` followed:
  // it is a synchronous string transformation over an already-validated colour
  // and issues no request, so listing it would misstate what this rule bans. It
  // carries a WRITTEN disposition in the DAV write manifest instead.
  //
  // No entry here is a prefix or a substring of it, and it contains none —
  // checked against the whole shipped alternation rather than eyeballed:
  // `createCalendarObject` is not contiguous inside it (this name spells
  // `CalendarCollection`), `listCalendars` shares only `Calendar`, and
  // `createEvent`, `createContact` and `createVCard` share only `create`. So
  // its per-name loop below can genuinely fail and the recorded prefix-shadow
  // exception list stays at two.
  "createCalendarCollection",
  // CALM-05's rename and recolour, and the FIRST entry on this list whose
  // request target is genuinely caller-supplied: the collection URL arrives
  // inside an opaque id rather than being built from the account's own resolved
  // home set. That changes nothing about why a fan-out is banned here — every
  // one of these is still a socket against the same account — but it is why the
  // home-containment gate drives a real hostile case against this one where the
  // create beside it is exempt.
  //
  // The temptation is the same sentence and slightly worse: "recolour all of
  // these" means N property updates, and a half-completed fan-out leaves an
  // account where some calendars were renamed, some recoloured and some
  // neither, with no answer that can say which.
  //
  // `observedOutcomes` is NOT among them, on `calendarColorForWire`'s
  // precedent: it is a pure comparison between a change the caller asked for and
  // a collection reading the caller already holds, and issues no request, so it
  // carries a WRITTEN disposition in the DAV write manifest instead. It replaced
  // `propstatOutcomes`, which held the same disposition for the same reason and
  // was retired in plan 17-10 — the answer it read carries no property keys at
  // all against the real account, so it reported a fault on every successful
  // write.
  //
  // Prefix-shadow check RUN against all 56 shipped alternation names rather
  // than eyeballed: it neither contains nor is contained by any of them.
  // `updateCalendarObject` is the near miss and is not contiguous inside it —
  // this name spells `CalendarCollection` — and `updateEvent`,
  // `updateContact` and `updateVCard` share only `update`. So its per-name loop
  // below can genuinely fail and the recorded prefix-shadow exception list
  // stays at two.
  "updateCalendarCollection",
  // CALM-06's count entry point: one depth-1 PROPFIND that answers what a
  // collection is bound to and exactly how many member resources go with it.
  //
  // The temptation it creates is the most natural fan-out in this phase, and it
  // is a READ, which is what makes it easy to justify. A previewing caller
  // wanting a member count for every calendar in the home is one sentence —
  // "which of my calendars are empty" — and the first thing anybody reaching
  // for it writes is a combinator over `listCalendars`' result, because that is
  // what makes nine round trips fast. Every one of those nine is a DAV request
  // against the same account, and the concurrent version returns the same
  // counts, so nothing about the answer would reveal the change. A
  // multi-collection count must be serial.
  //
  // `assertCtag` is NOT among them, on `observedOutcomes`' own precedent: it is
  // an assertion over a binding the caller already holds and issues no request,
  // so it carries a WRITTEN disposition in the DAV write manifest instead —
  // the same register `assertEtag`'s neighbouring entry uses.
  //
  // Prefix-shadow check RUN against the whole shipped alternation rather than
  // eyeballed: it neither contains nor is contained by any entry. `getEvent`
  // and `createCalendarCollection` are the near misses and neither is
  // contiguous inside it. So its per-name loop below can genuinely fail and the
  // recorded prefix-shadow exception list stays at two.
  "readCollectionState",
  // The discovery composite CALM-07 added, and the one entry on this list here for
  // the COMPOSITE paragraph's reason ALONE rather than for a new request shape. It
  // outlived CALM-07's withdrawal on 2026-09-26 because the function did — it is
  // the instrument that measured the property absent, and `dav_diagnose` still
  // reports what it reads, so it still issues its two serial PROPFINDs. It
  // ends in `propfind`, which is already on the library half below — so it
  // matched before it was written down, and it matched BY ACCIDENT. The accident
  // is the whole objection: a body that stopped calling `propfind` directly
  // would lose the coverage silently, and the guarantee would have been resting
  // on an implementation detail of the body rather than on a decision anyone
  // recorded.
  //
  // The shape it ships is the sharp one. TWO serial PROPFINDs inside one
  // function — the principal says where the scheduling inbox is, the inbox says
  // which calendar is the account's default — and that is precisely the pair a
  // combinator gets wrapped around, because that is what makes two round trips
  // fast. The concurrent version returns the same URL, so nothing about the
  // answer would reveal the change. And it cannot be raced at all: the second
  // request addresses a URL the first one supplies, so racing them asks about an
  // inbox nobody has resolved yet.
  //
  // **This entry is NOT arm-specific, and a later reader must not remove it as

  // outright: one whole account sweep per invitation, in parallel.
  //
  // Prefix-shadow check RUN for all three: none contains an entry, and none is

CONW-05 adds a fourth from phase 16, findDuplicateCandidates — the duplicate scan, and the case this rule's own text describes most directly: two probes over one address book is exactly the loop a combinator gets wrapped around, and the concurrent version returns the same candidates, so nothing about the answer reveals it. duplicateFilter is NOT among them either, on planContactCreateTarget's precedent: it assembles a report body and issues no request. CONW-02 and CONW-06 add the two halves of a conditional update — getContactWithEtag, the read that brings back the version stamp out of the same multi-status the plain read already issued, and updateContact, the overwrite that is conditional on it. Their read and their write are two SERIAL awaits and never a pair to be raced: racing them asks the server about a version nobody has read yet. CONW-02 adds one more composite, buildContactUpdatePreview, and it is the strongest instance of the COMPOSITE paragraph above: it ends in TWO guarded names rather than one, the read-with-a-version and the duplicate scan, so it would be covered only by accident through whichever of the two a later body still happened to call. Its two awaits are serial on purpose and the order is load-bearing, because the card is read first so the scan can be told which card to leave out of its own answer. Phase 17 (CALM-04) adds createCalendarCollection, the collection create and the first entry whose subject is a calendar rather than something inside one: once a calendar can be made, renamed or removed by name, 'tidy up my calendars' is one sentence that means N of them, and a half-completed fan-out over collections leaves whole calendars nobody chose. calendarColorForWire is NOT among them, on planCreateTarget's precedent: it is a synchronous string transformation over an already-validated colour and issues no request, so it carries a written manifest disposition instead. Phase 17 (CALM-05) adds updateCalendarCollection, the rename and recolour, and the first entry on this list whose request target is genuinely CALLER-SUPPLIED rather than built from the account's own resolved home set -- which is why the home-containment gate drives a real hostile case against it where the create beside it is exempt. observedOutcomes is NOT among them, on calendarColorForWire's own precedent: it is a pure comparison between a change the caller asked for and a collection reading the caller already holds, issues no request, and replaced propstatOutcomes when plan 17-10 retired that reader, so it carries a written manifest disposition instead. Phase 17 (CALM-06) adds readCollectionState, the count entry point, and it is the most natural fan-out this phase introduces precisely because it is a READ: 'which of my calendars are empty' is one sentence that means one depth-1 PROPFIND per calendar, the combinator is what makes nine round trips fast, and the concurrent version returns the same counts so nothing about the answer would reveal it. assertCtag is NOT among them, on observedOutcomes' own precedent: it is an assertion over a binding the caller already holds and issues no request, so it carries a written manifest disposition instead. Phase 17 adds resolveDefaultCalendarUrl, the discovery composite, and it is here for the COMPOSITE paragraph's reason alone: it ends in propfind, so it matched by ACCIDENT before it was written down, and the accident evaporates the first time its body is refactored. Its shipped shape is two SERIAL PROPFINDs in one function -- principal, then scheduling inbox -- which is the pair a combinator gets wrapped around because that is what makes two round trips fast, and the concurrent version returns the same URL so nothing about the answer would reveal it. The entry is deliberately NOT arm-specific: the arm a live measurement did not choose carried one request rather than two, and registering only against the sharper body would rest the guarantee on which arm a reader remembered. It also outlived the requirement it arrived for: CALM-07 was withdrawn on 2026-09-26 because the property it asks for is absent everywhere it can be asked, and the function was kept as the instrument of that measurement, so it is still two serial PROPFINDs and still the pair a combinator gets wrapped around. isDefaultCalendar WAS on this list as a NOT-among-them, on assertCtag's precedent, and it is not mentioned any more because the function was deleted with the requirement -- a written exclusion for a name that does not exist is a reason no reader can check. Phase 17 (CALM-06) adds the delete's three: deleteCalendarCollection, the DAV entry point, and the two TOOL-LAYER composites buildCollectionDeletePreview and applyCollectionCommit. The entry point is the most destructive name on this list -- every other write here changes something inside a collection and this one removes the collection and everything in it -- and 'get rid of these three' is the most natural multi-collection sentence this server will ever be handed, which is exactly where a combinator gets written. The two composites are on the COMPOSITE paragraph's terms and each ends in more than one guarded name: the preview in resolveDavAccount and readCollectionState, the commit in readCollectionState AND deleteCalendarCollection, so each would be covered only by accident and by whichever call a later body happened to keep. No new library primitive is needed: deleteObject, the helper the removal is issued through, has been on the library half since phase 14. Phase 17 adds runPropertyNameProbe, the third dav_diagnose probe and the instrument CALM-07's verdict was taken on: four resources, one depth-0 DAV:propname PROPFIND apiece, in a loop -- which is precisely where a combinator gets written, because that is what makes four round trips fast, and the concurrent version returns the same four property-name lists so nothing about the answer would reveal the change. It needs no new library primitive: davRequest, the raw helper it assembles the propname body through, has been on the library half since phase 14. propertyNamesInBody is NOT among them, for the reason every pure reader is left off -- it reads element names out of the raw multistatus BODY the probe already holds and issues no request -- and unlike that one it carries no manifest disposition either, correctly, because it is module-private and the manifest collects export function declarations. Phase 18 (RSVP-01, RSVP-04) adds three: resolveCalendarUserAddresses, the one PROPFIND that reads the account's whole address set and now runs on every invitation answer's preview and commit as well as on the invited create, so it is the name a sweep over invitations reaches for; and the two tool-layer composites buildReplyPreview and applyReplyCommit, which end in the event read, the address read and — for the commit — the one conditional write, so each would be covered only by accident, and a fan-out over the commit is 'accept all of these', where every leg may make iCloud send a reply to a real person that cannot be unsent. organizerAddressFrom and replyBody are NOT among them, on planCreateTarget's precedent: one is a selection over a list the caller already holds and the other a body builder over bytes already fetched, neither issues a request, and each carries a written manifest disposition instead. Phase 18 (RSVP-03) adds findWindowConflicts, the conflict sweep every answer's preview runs: findFreeSlots' own shape a second time, one enumeration and then collectFrom once per calendar in a serial loop, which is the loop a combinator gets wrapped around. busyIntervalOf is NOT among them: it places times the caller already holds and issues no request, so it carries a written manifest disposition instead. The phase's code review (WR-05) adds the three tool-layer composites that end in that sweep -- conflictsFor, seriesConflictsFor and sweepOrDegrade -- because none contained a listed name and a combinator over any of them passed the scan outright Phase 23 (D-32) adds the change check's three: calendarChangesSince, the loop over every calendar the account has, and its two private steps fetchCollectionStates and syncOneCalendar, named because the per-calendar step is where a refactor would put the combinator. readSyncAnswer is NOT among them: it reads responses the caller already holds and issues no request. Phase 23 (D-26) adds two more private steps of the same loop: changedEventRows, the one multiget per changed calendar, and reportOutcome, the sync REPORT with its failure sorted by type.",
