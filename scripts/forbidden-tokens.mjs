  // Phase 21, TRIA-07, D-10. iCloud has no move command, so a move here is the
  // copy, proven from the server's reply, then the removal of that ONE UID.
  // These two rules ban the two ways to get that wrong on the wire.
  //
  // WHAT EACH CATCHES. `mailbox-wide-expunge` catches a command line that starts
  // with the bare removal command or with CLOSE, either after an interpolated
  // tag (`${tag} ...`) or at the head of a string handed to the generic sender.
  // RFC 3501 gives both the same reach: every message in the folder that
  // carries the removal flag, including ones Apple Mail flagged and the user
  // can still recover (PITFALLS #31; CLOSE per RFC 3501 §6.4.2). Its second
  // half catches the UID-scoped removal when it names a range or a star, which
  // reaches every flagged message in that range just as the bare form does.
  // `move-command` catches the RFC 6851 move command, with or without its UID
  // prefix, at the same two anchors.
  //
  // WHAT NEITHER SEES. A lowercase command word. A command word held in a
  // variable and handed to the sender. A range built somewhere the pattern
  // cannot see and interpolated as one value. Those are held one layer up, by
  // the byte-exact recorded lines in test/move.test.ts, which read what was
  // actually written rather than the shape of the code that wrote it.
  //
  // THE PROSE DISCIPLINE. Both patterns read comments, and both are scoped to
  // the whole of `src/`. So describe both commands BY ROLE anywhere under
  // `src/` -- "the removal of that one UID", "the move command" -- and never
  // quote them. A comment that quotes one fails the check it was explaining,
  // and the failure arrives as a pre-commit rejection in an unrelated plan.
  // Tests and fixtures spell these on purpose, which is why the scope is `src/`.

  // ------------------------------------------------------- credentials in logs
  // FND-03, Pitfall 6. IMAP's LOGIN command carries the password inline in the
  // command stream, so there is no separately-named field a redactor could
  // target. The only reliable defence is that the credential path does not log.
  // Phase 8, CRED-05 (D-08). The last two names are not bindings. They are the
  // field names the grant's props use for the same two values, and they sit
  // beside the binding names because the leak is the same leak: a per-user
  // credential reaches a retained log through a line that names it. The three
  // binding names stay on the list even after the bindings themselves are
  // retired, because a rule that only refuses more costs nothing to keep.
  //
  // What it does not see: a different spelling or letter case of a name. The
  // names match as whole identifiers, with a word boundary on each side and no
  // case-insensitive flag, so a longer identifier that merely starts with one
  // is not caught. The rule below it for the props object is the wider net.
  //
  // Phase 9 (D-02). THE METHOD PART MATCHES ANY IDENTIFIER, IN ANY LETTER CASE.
  // It used to be lower-case letters only, so a timed-log or collapsed-group
  // call that passed a secret fired nothing here. The method is now any
  // identifier, with white space allowed before the parenthesis. Only the
  // method part changed: the span and the name list are what they were.
  //
  // WHAT THE METHOD PART STILL DOES NOT SEE. A computed member on the console
  // object, where the method name is a string in square brackets. A method
  // pulled out by destructuring and then called bare. An alias of the console
  // object, called through its new name. The optional-call form, where a
  // question mark and a dot sit between the method and the parenthesis. A
  // logger that is not named by either of the two words the pattern opens
  // with. All five are evasions rather than accidents, and this rule is aimed
  // at the accident. They are pinned by a test row that asserts the rule does
  // NOT fire on them, so nobody believes they are covered.
  //
  // THE MEMBER ACCESS WAS WIDENED TOO, IN ALL FIVE RULES TOGETHER (code review
  // WR-02). They used to demand a bare dot with nothing around it, and two
  // shapes therefore fired nothing. The first is an ACCIDENT, and it is why
  // this changed: the formatter breaks a long call after the object name, so a
  // debug line carrying a wide object is exactly the line that wraps. The
  // second is the optional-chaining member access, a question mark BEFORE the
  // dot. That is not the optional-CALL form listed above, which has the
  // question mark AFTER the method name and still escapes. White space, a new
  // line and an optional question mark are now allowed on either side of the
  // dot, in every rule that opens with these two words, so the five cannot
  // disagree with each other about it. The two new shapes only refuse more,
  // and each rule carries its own sample of both in the test file.
  //
  // Phase 27 (AUTO-07, D-21 as revised). SIX MORE NAMES, all for the autonomy
  // key. Autonomy is inherent: the server holds, for every signed-in person, a
  // token that signs in as them with nobody present. Its plaintext name, the
  // bearer made from it, its sealed field, its wire name and the two secrets
  // that guard it must never reach a log in any directory, so they join this
  // rule, which has no scope, and never a scoped copy of it.
  //
  // The wire name is also everyday OAuth vocabulary. A script or a test that
  // talks about token exchange may reach for it inside a log line. If this rule
  // fires on a line that looks innocent, reword the line. Never reword the rule.
  //
  // Phase 29.1 (SAVE-06, 29.1-WORDING.md decision 1a). ONE MORE NAME: the Worker
  // secret that seals every attachment save link. Whoever holds it can read
  // any link and make one for any person's stored copy, so it joins this rule

THREE OF THE TWELVE NAMES ARE DEAD BINDINGS and they stay on purpose: phase 13 deleted the account bindings and the login gate's secret from the platform, so nothing supplies those three now, but the rule only refuses MORE by keeping them -- and what it catches is a future session re-introducing a binding under one of those exact names, which is the singular-owner assumption coming back. Do not tidy them out. THE SIX AUTONOMY NAMES (phase 27, AUTO-07): autonomy is inherent, so this server holds, for every signed-in person, a token that signs in to their mail with nobody present. Its plaintext name, the bearer made from it, its sealed field, its OAuth wire name, and the two Worker secrets that seal it and prove the client must never reach a log in src/, scripts/ or test/: a retained log line holding one of them is a working key to somebody's mail, or the means to open every key at once.

  // logging call. Naming the gaps here is what stops a later reader believing
  // the rule proves more than it does.
  //
  // WHAT IT SEES BY MISTAKE, AND WHY THAT STAYS (code review WR-02). The rule

  // when the logging call has no semicolon after it. One of the five names is

  // word, so a script or a test helper that logs a plain message about DAV
  // discovery is refused, and nothing in it touches a credential.
  //
  // That is a recorded choice and not a bug to fix. A pattern that skipped

  // ---------------------------------------------------- writes onto the env object
  // Phase 8, CRED-05 (D-09). The environment object is shared: by every test in

  // the NEXT caller runs as, and nothing at the write site says so. It matches
  // nothing on the real tree today, and it is here before the per-user code is
  // written so that code is bound by it from its first commit.
  //
  // Three forms, the ones D-09 names: a member assignment, an index assignment,
  // and the object-merge call with the environment object as its TARGET. An
  // accessor chain is required before the operator, so declaring or rebinding a
  // local with this name is not a hit. The operator may be plain or compound,
  // and must not be the start of a comparison or an arrow. A spread copy with
  // fields overridden is a new object and is left alone: that is the permitted
  // form, and it is what the two-user test fixture does.
  //
  // WIDENED AFTER CODE REVIEW (WR-01). The first version needed the accessor
  // chain to start right after the object's name, and the type checker pushes
  // people away from that spelling. A plain write is a type error, so the next
  // thing an author tries is a type cast in parentheses, or a non-null mark.
  // Both sat between the name and the chain and hid the write. That is an
  // accident, not an evasion, and it is the exact case this rule exists for.
  // The rule now also sees:
  //   - a type cast in parentheses before the chain, single or chained;
  //   - a non-null mark after the name, or between two links of the chain;
  //   - the postfix increment and decrement;
  //   - the prefix increment and decrement, which is its own arm because the
  //     operator comes BEFORE the name. That arm needs an accessor right after
  //     the name with no space, so a command-line flag spelled with two dashes
  //     and this name is not a hit when a space, an equals sign or the end of
  //     the string follows the name. A flag with a DOTTED suffix is a hit: see
  //     the over-match section below;
  //   - a computed key that itself holds one level of square brackets.
  // Every one of these refuses more and none refuses less. Each has its own
  // sample row in ENV_WRITE_FORMS in test/forbidden-tokens.test.ts.
  //
  // THE NON-NULL MARK OWNS THE WHITE SPACE IN FRONT OF IT, AND ONLY THAT (second
  // code review, WR-01). Inside the chain loop the mark and its leading white
  // space are optional TOGETHER, as one group, and one white-space run follows.
  // The first widened version had a white-space run on EACH side of an optional
  // mark. With no mark present, one space before a dot could be taken by either
  // run, which is two ways to match every link. On a chain that does not end in
  // a write the engine tried every combination, so the cost doubled per link:
  // about 25 spaced links took seconds, and a new line counts as white space,
  // so an ordinary multi-line chain has that shape. This rule has no scope and
  // runs in both gates, so one such line would hang the hook with no message.
  // The two forms match exactly the same strings. Do not split that group back
  // into two optional pieces. A timing test in test/forbidden-tokens.test.ts
  // holds it, over several thousand spaced links and a multi-line variant.
  //
  // EVERY ARM OF THE COMPOUND-OPERATOR GROUP HAS ITS OWN SAMPLE ROW TOO (code

  // WHAT IT SEES BY MISTAKE, AND WHY THAT STAYS (code review WR-03). The rule
  // is anchored on the WORD and not on the object, and it reads text, not
  // syntax. Three innocent shapes are refused:
  //   - a write onto the Node process's own environment table, which is a
  //     normal thing for a file under scripts/ to do;
  //   - a write onto the build tool's environment table, the one that hangs
  //     off the module metadata object;
  //   - a COMMENT or a string that spells the banned form out as an example.
  // The third is the trap CLAUDE.md sections 1 and 2 already warn about for
  // other rules: a comment that explains a ban by example fails the check it
  // explains, and the failure arrives as a rejected commit in the middle of
  // unrelated work. DESCRIBE THE BANNED FORM BY ROLE in comments and test
  // titles -- "a write onto the environment object" -- and never by example.
  // This comment does exactly that.
  //
  // TWO MORE, FROM THE PREFIX ARM (second code review, IN-05). That arm opens on
  // two dashes, allows a space, then wants the name and an accessor. So it also
  // fires on:
  //   - a double dash used as PUNCTUATION in a comment or a string, right in
  //     front of a plain read of a field on this object. Nothing in such a line
  //     spells a write out, so "describe it by role" does not help its author:
  //     the line already does. The plain fix is a different dash, or a word
  //     between the dash and the name;
  //   - a command-line flag spelled with two dashes, this name, a dot and a
  //     suffix. Pass the value as its own argument instead.
  // Both stay, for the same reason as the three above: a pattern cannot tell a
  // decrement from a dash, and a rule that skipped comments and strings would
  // skip real code held in a template.
  //
  // That is a recorded choice and not a bug to fix. Anchoring on the object
  // would need the rule to know which object a name refers to, and a pattern
  // cannot. A dotted-path exception would also hide a write through any holder
  // of the real object, which is a form the rule sees today on purpose. WHEN
  // THIS FIRES ON AN INNOCENT LINE: set the process variable from outside the
  // script (the command line or the runner's config), or hand a child process
  // a fresh copy with the field overridden, or reword the comment. Never
  // loosen the pattern. The over-match is pinned by test rows that assert the
  // rule DOES fire on those lines, so a later "fix" that narrows it goes red.

That object is shared by every test in a file and every request in an isolate, so a write onto it is how one user's identity leaks into another test or another request. Build a fresh copy with the two account fields overridden instead. The rule matches the word and reads text, so it also fires on a write onto the Node process's environment table or the build tool's, and on a comment or string that spells the write out. If that is what happened, set the variable from outside the script or pass a fresh copy, or describe the form by role in the comment. It also fires on a double dash used as punctuation right before a read of a field on this object, and on a command-line flag made of two dashes, this name, a dot and a suffix. If that is what happened, use a different dash or put a word between, or pass the flag's value as its own argument. Do not loosen this rule.",

  //
  // Phase 20 (D-07) added a second orchestrator, the mutating one, over the
  // same private core and the same request gate. So there are two prefixes
  // now, and both are named in the alternation. Each is still a prefix match:
  // the over-a-stream variants (`...Over`) are covered by the same name,
  // because a session over an already-open stream is still one conversation
  // against the account, and N of them is N. The private core's name begins
  // with the read prefix on purpose, so a fan-out written around the core is
  // covered too. A test reads every session-opening function name out of
  // src/mail/service.ts and runs a fan-out around each through this rule, so
  // a new orchestrator whose name escapes both prefixes goes red there.
  //
  // Phase 21 (D-10) lists the triage verbs too, and the move composites above
  // them. Phase 20 left them out and said this phase would revisit it. It
  // does, because list operations now exist: "archive all of these" is one
  // sentence, and a combinator over a map of moves is the first thing anyone
  // writes for it. The shared gate would refuse that at run time, since every
  // verb reaches the mutating orchestrator. The scan refusing it at commit
  // time is cheaper, as CLAUDE.md section 3 says, because nothing has to run.
  //
  // So the alternation now also names, innermost outwards:
  //
  //   - the verbs exported from src/mail/triage.ts: markRead, markUnread,
  //     flagMessage, unflagMessage, moveMessages. Prefix matches again, so
  //     each `...Over` variant is covered by the same name. `unflagMessage` is
  //     listed on its own for legibility, even though `flagMessage` already
  //     matches inside it: the tests read names, not prefixes;
  //   - readMoveSet, the read the move preview opens a session for;
  //   - buildMovePreview and applyMailCommit, the composites in
  //     src/mcp/tools/mail.ts that a tool reaches for.
  //
  // A name missing from an alternation is invisible to every set check, which
  // is the hole `DAV_WRITE_MODULES` closes for the DAV rule below. The same
  // hole is closed here by a test instead: it reads every function
  // src/mail/triage.ts exports and runs a fan-out around each through this
  // rule, so a verb added later without a name here turns that test red.
  //
  // Phase 24 (D-10 e) names the lease runner too, `withConnectionLease` in
  // src/agent/lease.ts. Every mail tool now reaches its session through it,
  // so it is the outermost name a fan-out would be written around. The
  // structural half does refuse a second concurrent lease for the same person,
  // but it refuses it as connection_busy at run time, after the fan-out was
  // already written and shipped. The scan refuses it at commit time.
  //
  // Phase 25 (D-17) names the two recall build entry points in
  // src/recall/build.ts: `indexNextPage` and `reconcileMailbox`. Each takes the
  // person's connection lease and reads mail through one session, so a fan-out
  // over mailboxes or pages is the same N sockets as a fan-out over the lease
  // runner itself. The object refuses a second page in flight at run time; the
  // scan refuses the fan-out before it ships.
  //
  // Phase 26 (D-20 c) names the recall step and the reads it opens a session
  // for. `recallStep` in src/recall/sync.ts is the step; `runRecallStep` in
  // src/recall/drive.ts is its one runner; `indexNewMail` in src/recall/sync.ts
  // indexes new mail; `newMailPage` in src/recall/mail-source.ts is the page
  // source it reads; `windowUids` and `summariesInRange` in src/mail/service.ts
  // are the two new reads, and their stream forms (`windowUidsOver`,
  // `summariesInRangeOver`) are covered by the prefix match. `runRecallStep`
  // is not shadowed by `recallStep`: the match is case-sensitive and the

  //
  // 26-REVIEW WR-08 names the wrappers the step actually opens its sessions

  // wrapper), `checkBuilt` (a built folder's status check) and `syncDeletions`
  // (a built folder's deletion sync) in src/recall/sync.ts, and the two
  // Phase 23 reads the step reaches through its deps, `folderSnapshots` and
  // `listFolders` in src/mail/service.ts. A fan-out written as
  // `Promise.all(folders.map((f) => underLease(principal, deps, read)))`
  // named none of the listed tokens, so only the runtime gate would have
  // refused it. Measured at zero hits on the real tree before it was armed.
  //
  // Phase 28 (D-21 (f), AUTO-13) names the rules job's three entry points:
  // `withAutonomySession` in src/agent/autonomy.ts, the one way the object
  // opens a session with the autonomy key, and the job's two actions,
  // `setFlag` and `placeDraft` in src/agent/actions.ts. Each action is one or
  // two tool calls at /mcp, and each call is one iCloud session under the
  // person's lease, so a combinator over a list of verdicts is the same N
  // sockets as a combinator over the lease runner. The job's own call function
  // is too common a name to list; `autonomy-job-combinator` holds the file that
  // uses it. Measured at zero hits on the real tree before it was armed.
  //
  // Phase 29.1.1 (LD-4) names the recall backfill: `recallBackfill` in
  // src/recall/sync.ts, the loop that indexes several pages in one call, and
  // `runRecallBackfill` in src/recall/drive.ts, its one runner. Every page the
  // loop indexes takes the person's lease and opens one session, so a
  // combinator around either is the same N sockets as one around the lease
  // runner. `runRecallBackfill` is not shadowed by `recallBackfill`: the match
  // is case-sensitive and the runner spells the loop with a capital. Measured
  // at zero hits on the real tree before it was armed.
  //
  // Phase 29.1 (SAVE-06) names the save path's two: `getAttachmentsForSave` in
  // src/mail/service.ts, the one read-only session that fetches a message's
  // attachments for saving (its stream form, `getAttachmentsForSaveOver`, is
  // covered by the prefix), and `saveParts` in src/save/stage.ts, the loop that
  // stores each part and mints its link. The read is a session, so a
  // combinator over several messages is several sockets. The loop holds each
  // part in memory while it stores it, so a combinator over several calls holds
  // several parts at once and multiplies the storage calls; it must stay one

Each recall build entry point takes the person's connection lease and reads mail through one session, so it is a session like the others. The same holds for the recall step (recallStep in src/recall/sync.ts), its one runner (runRecallStep in src/recall/drive.ts), the new-mail indexer (indexNewMail) and page source (newMailPage), the two recall reads in src/mail/service.ts (windowUids, summariesInRange, and their stream forms), the step's own lease wrapper and the two per-folder actions it opens a session for (underLease, checkBuilt, syncDeletions in src/recall/sync.ts), and the two reads the step reaches through its deps (folderSnapshots, listFolders in src/mail/service.ts): the recall step and its reads each open the person's one iCloud connection. Each of those opens a session, and every session is a socket, so a fan-out over N mailboxes opens N of them: production allows six simultaneous connections per Worker invocation (counting KV reads and outbound fetches, one of which the OAuth provider has already spent), and iCloud's own per-account ceiling is lower, undocumented, and deliberately unmeasured because exhausting it locks the user out of their own mail in Mail.app on their own devices.

Act on verdicts one at a time. The save path is named too: getAttachmentsForSave in src/mail/service.ts (and its stream form), the one read-only session that fetches a message's attachments for saving, and saveParts in src/save/stage.ts, the loop that stores each part and mints its link.

  //
  // The alternation names THREE layers, and the scope is `src/` rather than
  // `src/dav/` for the sake of the third.
  //
  // T-03-27 claimed this rule was "modelled directly on the two existing
  // combinator rules". It was not, and 03-REVIEW.md WR-03 found the gap: the
  // raw-name half below is modelled on `concurrent-connect`, which guards the
  // primitive, while the rule it was supposed to mirror is
  // `concurrent-session`, which guards the ORCHESTRATOR and is scoped to the
  // whole of `src/` in order to reach it. Scoped to `src/dav/` over tsdav names
  // only, `Promise.all(ids.map((id) => getEvent(env, davFetch, id)))` written in
  // `src/mcp/tools/calendar.ts` matched nothing at all -- and that is the layer
  // a fan-out actually gets written at, for exactly the reason the mail rule
  // gives: nobody wraps a combinator around a library primitive, because the
  // tool code never sees one.
  //
  // So, innermost outwards:
  //
  //   - `davFetch` -- what a hand-rolled request reaches for.
  //   - the tsdav standalone functions -- what a "just fetch them all" edit
  //     inside `src/dav/` reaches for.
  //   - the service entry points, plus `withRediscovery` and `pagedEvents` --
  //     what a tool reaches for, and the only names visible from `src/mcp/`.
  //     Every one of them ends in one or more DAV round trips, so N of them
  //     concurrently is N conversations against one account.
  //
  // Each of those three layers carries a WRITE half as well as a read half, and
  // the write half is the sharper argument. The account-wide read sweep this
  // rule's reason cites was withdrawn because it could not be repaired by
  // making it concurrent -- but a read that loses the race merely returns a
  // worse answer, and the user's calendar is unchanged either way. A sweep over
  // WRITES cannot be repaired at all: each request in it changes the user's
  // calendar, so a half-completed fan-out leaves a state nobody chose, no retry
  // can describe it, and the events it did reach cannot be put back. "Clear my
  // calendar for August" is one sentence, and a combinator over a map is the
  // first thing anyone reaching for it writes -- which is precisely why the
  // three write helpers and the four service write entry points are named here
  // rather than left to the structural half alone.
  //
  // `resolveOrganizerAddress` is named on the same footing as `withRediscovery`
  // and `resolveDavAccount`: it is not a write, but it costs one PROPFIND at
  // the principal and is reachable from `src/mcp/`. It was already covered by
  // accident -- its body wraps `withRediscovery`, which is on this list -- and
  // covering a name by accident is how a guarantee quietly leaves when the body
  // is refactored. Its sibling `planCreateTarget` is deliberately absent: that
  // one mints a UID and a URL synchronously and issues no request, and this
  // rule's subject is round trips against one account.
  //
  // The EIGHT composite entry points at the end of the alternation --
  // `applyCommit`, `buildPreview`, `buildDeletePreview`, `buildCreatePreview`,
  // `occurrenceBody`, `scopelessBody`, `applyNarrowedDelete` and
  // `observeDelivery`, all in
  // `src/mcp/tools/calendar.ts` -- are named for exactly the reason
  // `resolveOrganizerAddress` is, and it is the sentence in the paragraph above:
  // every one of them was covered BY ACCIDENT, because every one of their bodies
  // calls a name already on this list, and covering a name by accident is how a
  // guarantee quietly leaves when the body is refactored.
  //
  // They are also the layer this rule's own `why` says a fan-out actually gets
  // written at -- "a tool in src/mcp/tools/ never sees a tsdav call, only
  // getEvent or searchContacts". The four service write entry points closed the
  // layer beneath this one; these close this one.
  // `combinator(ids.map((id) => buildDeletePreview(...)))` -- "preview deleting
  // all of these" -- is the shape, and it did not fire.
  //
  // All three `Preview` names need their own entry: `buildPreview` is not a
  // prefix of `buildCreatePreview` or `buildDeletePreview`, so the prefix
  // relation described for `getEventWithEtag` below does NOT apply to them and
  // none of the three covers either of the others. That is asserted rather than
  // claimed -- test/forbidden-tokens.test.ts checks the whole alternation for
  // names matched through another entry and pins the exact list of exceptions.
  //
  // `getEventWithEtag` is named for legibility and for the set-equality in
  // test/forbidden-tokens.test.ts, NOT because the pattern needs it: `getEvent`
  // precedes it in the alternation and is a prefix of it, so the name already
  // matched before it was written down. Its per-name loop assertion is
  // therefore redundant by construction and cannot fail; the set-equality is
  // what actually holds it here. Recorded rather than repaired, because the
  // repair -- a trailing word boundary on the group -- would make this rule
  // match strictly LESS than it does today, and narrowing a safety rule to
  // tidy an assertion is the move the Conventions forbid outright.
  //
  // `buildContactUpdatePreview` is phase 16's last composite and it is named on
  // exactly the same footing. It ends in TWO of the names beside it -- the
  // read-with-a-version and the duplicate scan -- which makes it two temptations
  // rather than one, and makes "covered by accident" twice as easy to arrive at:
  // a body that stopped calling either one would still match through the other,
  // and the guarantee would be resting on which of the two survived the refactor.
  // It contains no existing entry as a substring, so its per-name loop in
  // test/forbidden-tokens.test.ts can genuinely fail and the recorded
  // prefix-shadow exception list does not grow.
  //
  // Phase 18's three conflict composites (18-REVIEW WR-05) are named on the
  // same footing: `conflictsFor`, `seriesConflictsFor` and `sweepOrDegrade`,
  // each ending in `findWindowConflicts` and each containing no listed name, so
  // a combinator over any of them passed this rule until they were written
  // down. Each needs its own entry. The review that filed them expected
  // `conflictsFor` to cover `seriesConflictsFor`, but this pattern is
  // case-sensitive and the series name spells `ConflictsFor` with a capital,
  // so neither shadows the other and the prefix-shadow exception list in
  // test/forbidden-tokens.test.ts stays at two.
  //
  // The structural half remains the per-request serialisation gate in
  // `src/dav/transport.ts`, which is what independently held the connection
  // budget while this rule's reach was short of its claim.
  //
  // Same statement-bounded span as the two rules above, for the same reason the

    why: "A concurrent combinator wrapped around a DAV request, or around one of the service entry points that ends in one. The platform cap is not the reason: workerd queues a seventh simultaneous connection until one of the six receives its response headers, so exhausting that budget costs latency rather than an error. The reason is iCloud's own per-account ceiling, which is lower, undocumented, and deliberately unmeasured -- because exhausting it does not fail politely, it locks the user out of their own mail in Mail.app on their own devices. The entry points are named as well as the library primitives, and the scope is the whole of src/, because that is where a fan-out is actually written: a tool in src/mcp/tools/ never sees a tsdav call, only getEvent or searchContacts, and even a single-calendar listing is already three serial round trips before anything multiplies it -- it was nineteen while an account-wide listing existed, and that form was withdrawn precisely because the sweep could not be repaired by making it concurrent. The WRITE entry points are named alongside the reads, and they are the sharper case: a read that loses the race returns a worse answer and leaves the calendar alone, while a half-completed fan-out over writes leaves a state nobody chose, that no retry can describe, and that cannot be put back. The COMPOSITE tool-layer entry points are named alongside both -- the three preview builders, the commit, the narrowed delete, the occurrence patch and the delivery observation -- because each of them ends in one or more of the names beside it and each was therefore covered only by accident, which is how a guarantee quietly leaves when a body is refactored; they are also, by this rule's own reasoning above, the exact layer a fan-out gets written at. Phase 6 (SCHED-01) adds findFreeSlots and collectFrom: findFreeSlots is the new orchestrator that sweeps every calendar the account has for free/busy time, exactly the account-wide shape D-84 reintroduces, and collectFrom is now called in a loop over collections for the first time -- pagedEvents called it once per request, so it carried no fan-out risk and was correctly absent before, and the temptation to wrap that new loop in a combinator is the precise Pitfall 3 this extension closes. This rule bans CONCURRENCY and not request count -- the two-request serial commit a scoped calendar change deliberately pays is permitted, because a patch needs the whole resource and rebuilding drops every component it did not rebuild. tsdav additionally fans out INSIDE its own fetchCalendars and fetchAddressBooks, in a directory this scanner cannot walk, which is why the structural half of the guarantee is the per-request serialisation gate in src/dav/transport.ts rather than anything visible at a call site; this is the detective half. Phase 14 (SPIKE-02, SPIKE-04) adds makeCalendar, davRequest and deleteObject as library primitives and runCollectionWriteProbe and runTaskCollectionProbe as service entry points, for the two reasons this text already separates. The write probe creates, renames, recolours and deletes a throwaway collection, so a fan-out over it is precisely the half-completed state the WRITE paragraph above calls the sharper case -- except worse, because the half-completed state here is a COLLECTION left on the account rather than an event, and the probe's own cleanup verification is what a combinator would race. The to-do listing is the shape this rule was written for outright: a loop over collections, one calendar-query per collection, which is exactly where a combinator gets written because it is what makes N round trips fast -- the same temptation collectFrom's loop introduced one phase earlier. Phase 16 (CONW-01) adds createVCard as a library primitive and createContact, buildContactCreatePreview and applyContactCommit for the two reasons this text already separates. A contact write is ONE card per request, and a fan-out over contact writes is the same half-completed state the WRITE paragraph above calls the sharper case -- 'add all of these people' is one sentence, and what it leaves behind on a partial failure is an address book holding some of a list nobody can name. The two composites are named beside the service entry point on the COMPOSITE paragraph's own terms: each ends in one or more of the names beside it, so each would be covered only by accident, and a body is a refactor away from not doing that. Phase 16 (CONW-05) adds findDuplicateCandidates, and it is the case this rule's own text describes most directly: two probes over one address book is exactly the loop somebody wraps in a combinator, because that is what makes two round trips fast, and the concurrent version returns the same candidates -- so nothing about the answer would reveal it. It needs no new library primitive, because every request it issues is already named beside it: the filtered query, the enumeration and the bulk read. It is also the one entry point here whose whole purpose is advisory, which makes it the easiest to justify speeding up and the least likely to be noticed doing so. Phase 16 (CONW-02, CONW-06) adds updateVCard as a library primitive and getContactWithEtag and updateContact as service entry points, for the two reasons this text already separates. An UPDATE is one card per request, and its read and its write are two SERIAL awaits rather than a pair to be raced -- the read is what produces the version stamp the write is conditional on, so racing them is not merely a connection-budget problem, it is asking the server about a version nobody has read yet. A fan-out over updates is the same half-completed state the WRITE paragraph above calls the sharper case, and worse than the create's: 'fix everyone's job title' leaves an address book in which some cards were overwritten and the rest were not, and the ones that were cannot be put back. A multi-collection operation must be serial. Phase 16 (CONW-02) adds one more composite, buildContactUpdatePreview, on the COMPOSITE paragraph's own terms: it ends in getContactWithEtag AND in findDuplicateCandidates, so it is two ways to be tempted into a combinator rather than one, and it would be covered only by accident through whichever of the two a later body still happened to call. Its two awaits are serial on purpose and the order is load-bearing: the card is read first so the scan can be told which card to leave out of its own answer. Phase 17 (CALM-04) adds createCalendarCollection, and it is the first entry point on this list whose SUBJECT is a collection rather than something inside one. The temptation this phase introduces has a shape the earlier ones did not: an account holds nine calendars, and once one of them can be made, renamed or removed by name, 'tidy up my calendars' is one sentence that means N of them -- and the first thing anybody reaching for that writes is a combinator, because that is what makes N round trips fast. Every one of those round trips is a DAV request against the same account. iCloud's own per-account ceiling is lower than the platform's six, undocumented, and deliberately unmeasured, because exhausting it does not fail politely: it locks the user out of their own mail in Mail.app on their own devices. It is also the WRITE paragraph's sharper case taken one level up -- a half-completed fan-out over collections leaves whole calendars nobody chose, some made and some not, and on the rename and delete that follow in plans 17-04 and 17-06, some gone. A multi-collection operation must be serial. It needs no new library primitive: davRequest, the raw request helper this create assembles its extended MKCOL through, has been on this list since phase 14. Phase 17 (CALM-06) adds readCollectionState, the collection count entry point, and the temptation it creates is the most natural fan-out in this phase precisely because it is a READ, which is what makes it easy to justify: 'which of my calendars are empty' is one sentence that means one depth-1 PROPFIND per calendar, the combinator is what makes nine round trips fast, and the concurrent version returns the same counts so nothing about the answer would reveal the change. A multi-collection count must be serial. Phase 17 adds resolveDefaultCalendarUrl, and it is on this list on the COMPOSITE paragraph's own terms rather than for a new request shape: the function ENDS in propfind, so leaving it off would leave it covered only by accident, and the accident evaporates the first time its body is refactored -- which is exactly how buildContactUpdatePreview and the collection composites above are argued. The shape it ships is the sharp one. It is TWO serial PROPFINDs inside one function, principal then scheduling inbox then default calendar, and that is the pair somebody wraps in a combinator because that is what makes two round trips fast; the concurrent version returns the same URL, so nothing about the answer would reveal the change; and the second request needs the first's answer, so racing them is not merely a connection-budget problem, it is asking about an inbox nobody has resolved yet. THE ENTRY IS NOT ARM-SPECIFIC AND MUST NOT BE READ AS LEFTOVER FROM A BRANCH THAT DID NOT SHIP. A measurement against the real account chose between two already-decided implementations of this function, and the other one carried ONE request rather than two -- a weaker temptation, and registered on exactly the same footing, because which arm shipped is a fact about a checkpoint answer rather than a fact about whether a later session can fan this out. A registration that held against the two-request body and not the one-request body would be a registration resting on which arm a reader remembered. IT ALSO SURVIVED THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUIREMENT IT ARRIVED FOR. CALM-07 was withdrawn on 2026-09-26 because the property this function asks for does not exist server-side, and the function was KEPT anyway -- it is the instrument that took that measurement and dav_diagnose still reports what it reads, so it still issues its two serial PROPFINDs and is still the pair somebody would race. Phase 17 (CALM-06) adds deleteCalendarCollection as the DAV entry point and buildCollectionDeletePreview and applyCollectionCommit as the two tool-layer composites, and this is the most expensive fan-out in the phase to get wrong rather than merely the newest. A caller asked to tidy up several calendars is the most natural multi-collection sentence anybody will ever type at this server -- \"get rid of these three\" -- and the first thing anybody reaching for it writes is a combinator, because that is what makes three round trips fast. Every parallel leg is a DESTRUCTIVE request against the same account, which is the WRITE paragraph's sharper case taken as far as it goes: a half-completed fan-out here leaves whole calendars gone that nobody chose, and every event, to-do and unparseable resource inside each of them, with no answer that can say which and no retry that can put any of it back. iCloud's per-account ceiling is lower than the platform's six, undocumented, and deliberately unmeasured, so a fan-out cannot even be sized before it is attempted. A multi-collection delete must be serial, and there is no batch shape that makes it safe -- doing LESS work is the answer rather than doing the same work faster. The two composites are named on the COMPOSITE paragraph's own terms and each ends in more than one name beside it: the preview ends in resolveDavAccount and readCollectionState, and the commit ends in readCollectionState AND deleteCalendarCollection, so each would be covered only by accident and by whichever of its calls a later refactor happened to keep. The commit's three requests -- the binding re-read, the removal, and the fresh look that verifies it -- are serial on purpose and the order is load-bearing twice over: the re-read is what decides whether the removal is sent at all, and the fresh look is the only evidence this project accepts that the removal landed, so racing either with the removal would be asking about a collection nobody has decided to delete yet or looking before the delete arrived. It needs no new library primitive: deleteObject, the helper the removal is issued through, has been on this list since phase 14. Phase 17 adds runPropertyNameProbe, the third `dav_diagnose` probe, and it is on this list for the reason the probes beside it are rather than for a new request shape: it ends in davRequest, which has been on the library half since phase 14, so it matched by ACCIDENT before it was written down and the accident evaporates the first time its body is refactored. The shape it ships is the one this rule was written for outright. It is a LOOP over four resources -- the principal, the calendar home, the scheduling inbox and one calendar -- issuing one depth-0 `DAV:propname` PROPFIND apiece, which is exactly where a combinator gets written because that is what makes four round trips fast, and the concurrent version returns the same four property-name lists so nothing about the answer would reveal the change. Being a READ is what makes it easy to justify speeding up, exactly as readCollectionState's entry above records: it writes nothing, so a fan-out here costs no calendar state -- but every leg is still a socket against one account, iCloud's own per-account ceiling is lower than the platform's six, undocumented and deliberately unmeasured, and exhausting it locks the user out of their own mail in Mail.app on their own devices. Four round trips plus discovery and the home listing is already most of one invocation's budget before anything multiplies it. propertyNamesInBody is NOT on this list, for the reason every pure reader here is left off: it reads element names out of the raw multistatus BODY the probe already holds and issues no request. That clause named isDefaultCalendar as its precedent until 2026-09-26, when CALM-07's withdrawal deleted that function; a precedent citing a name that no longer exists is a reason a reader cannot check. It reads the body rather than the library's parse because that parse could not answer the question at all -- a defect measured live on 2026-09-25 and recorded in its own section in src/dav/diagnose.ts -- and the swap changes nothing about this rule's reasoning, because a reader of a string issues no more requests than a reader of an object. It carries no manifest disposition either, and that is correct rather than an omission -- it is module-private, and the manifest collects `export function` declarations, so a name that is not exported is not a name the tool layer can reach. Phase 18 (RSVP-01, RSVP-04) adds resolveCalendarUserAddresses, the read of the account's whole calendar-user address set, and buildReplyPreview and applyReplyCommit, the two tool-layer composites that answer an invitation. Each ends in DAV round trips against one account. The address read is ONE PROPFIND at the principal, and it now runs on every answer's preview AND commit as well as on the invited create, so it is the name a sweep reaches for: 'what did I answer to everything this week' is one sentence that means one read per invitation, and a combinator is what makes that fast. The preview ends in the event read and the address read; the commit ends in the event read, the address read and the one conditional write. Their awaits are serial on purpose and the order is load-bearing: the event read brings back the ETag the write is conditional on, and racing the write against the read that decides whether it may be sent is asking about a resource nobody has read yet. A fan-out over answers is the WRITE paragraph's sharper case with one more thing that cannot be taken back: each answer may make iCloud send a reply to a real person, and 'accept all of these' half-done leaves some organisers told and some not, with no answer that can say which. A multi-invitation answer must be serial. It needs no new library primitive: every request these three issue is already named beside them. Phase 18 (RSVP-03) adds findWindowConflicts, the sweep that finds what else is on the calendar in an invitation's window, and it is findFreeSlots' own shape run a second time: one enumeration, then collectFrom once per calendar in a plain serial loop, on every answer's preview -- the loop a combinator gets wrapped around because that is what makes nine round trips fast, and the concurrent version finds the same conflicts so nothing about the answer would reveal the change. Phase 18's code review (WR-05) adds the three tool-layer composites that end in that sweep -- conflictsFor for a one-off invitation, seriesConflictsFor for a series, and sweepOrDegrade, which both call -- on the COMPOSITE paragraph's own terms: none of them contained a listed name, so a combinator over them passed this rule outright, and 'check what clashes with each of these invitations' is one sentence that means one whole account sweep per invitation. Phase 23 (CHNG-01, D-32) adds syncCollection as a library primitive and calendarChangesSince, syncOneCalendar and fetchCollectionStates as service entry points, and the change check is this rule's shape in its plainest form. It is a loop over every calendar the account has: one PROPFIND at the home for every token, then one sync REPORT for each calendar whose token moved, one after another. That loop is exactly what a combinator gets written around, because that is what makes nine round trips fast, and the concurrent version returns the same counts -- so nothing in the answer would reveal it. It is also a check the user may run several times a day, which makes the cost of a fan-out a daily cost rather than an occasional one. syncOneCalendar is module-private and named anyway: it is the step the loop repeats, and the per-calendar step is where a refactor would put the combinator. readSyncAnswer is NOT on this list, for the reason every pure reader here is left off: it reads responses the caller already holds and issues no request. Phase 23 (D-26) adds changedEventRows, the one calendar-multiget per changed calendar that reads the event rows, and reportOutcome, the step that sends one sync REPORT and sorts its failure. Both are module-private and named anyway, on the COMPOSITE paragraph's terms: each is called once per calendar inside the loop, so the per-calendar step is where a refactor would put the combinator, and the concurrent version returns the same rows and counts. eventChangeFactsOf is NOT on this list: it parses bytes the caller already holds and issues no request.",

The request is never built, so no byte leaves the Worker and no server ever sees it. That would be harmless if it failed honestly, and it does not: the `TypeError` is raised inside `createDavFetch`'s `try` around the fetch, which mapped every caught value to `DavConnectError`, and `davToErrorCategory` defaults that to `connection_failed` -- so the caller was told \"Could not establish a secure connection to iCloud Mail. This may be transient -- safe to retry once\", and every clause of that was false. No connection was attempted, nothing was transient, and no retry could ever work. This is MEASURED rather than hypothetical: it is what SPIKE-04's first live probe run actually reported to the owner on 2026-09-24, against the real account, and that report was on its way into a written verdict about what iCloud does with collection writes when it was a fact about what Cloudflare does with a method string. The route this project takes instead is RFC 5689 extended `MKCOL`, which expresses the same intent with a method this platform will send. A LEGITIMATE mention -- a docstring explaining the constraint, a test constructing the string to prove the runtime still refuses it -- is fixed AT THE SOURCE, by building the string from fragments or by naming the method by its role, exactly as `src/mail/socket.ts` already does for the banned transport paths. It is never fixed by narrowing this pattern and never by adding a file to EXCLUDED: ./.claude/CLAUDE.md's Enforcement section is explicit that exclusion is by PATH and never by making a rule see less, and EXCLUDED is all-rules-per-file, so skipping a file here silently drops its fan-out, logging, host-literal and read-only coverage too.",

  // ------------------------------------------------------------- store scoping
  // ISO-06, D-13, D-21. Phase 10.
  //
  // THE RULE. Every KV and R2 key this project writes belongs to exactly one
  // person. The staging bucket holds that person's attachments, the confirm
  // namespace holds their pending writes, and the DAV cache holds their
  // account's home URLs. So a key expression built under `src/` from a key
  // prefix constant must put the user id straight after that constant, and
  // nothing else may sit between the two.
  //
  // WHY THIS SHAPE, AND NOT THE LITERAL READING OF D-13. D-13 says "a key
  // prefix constant declared under src/ that carries no user segment". Read as
  // "the constant's own value must contain a user id" that is unsatisfiable: a
  // module-scope constant is evaluated once when the isolate boots and there is
  // no user then. ISO-06's own wording says a key **built** under `src/`, and
  // that is the readable version: a USE of a prefix constant in a key
  // expression that does not put a user id straight after it. Anchoring on the
  // prefix constants is also how the rule finds a key expression at all. A rule
  // over every string that merely looks like a key would fire on test data, on
  // comments, and on the OAuth library's own documented key shapes, so it does
  // not exist.
  //
  // WHY A KEY WITHOUT A USER SEGMENT IS THE FAILURE. It is a key any signed-in
  // caller can name. One person's object becomes reachable through another
  // person's request, and nothing fails on the way in -- the store returns the
  // object it was asked for, which is exactly what it is built to do.
  //
  // WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. Every one of these builds a key with no user id and
  // fires nothing:
  //
  //   1. concatenation instead of a template: `CONFIRM_KEY_PREFIX + jti`;
  //   2. a key built from a bare literal at the call site, with no prefix
  //      constant at all;
  //   3. a prefix constant renamed so it no longer ends in `PREFIX`, or no
  //      longer contains one of the eight store words;
  //   4. the user id interpolated under another name -- `${who}`, `${uid}`.
  //      The rule keys on the spelling `userId`, optionally behind up to three
  //      member accesses, so `${userId}`, `${actor.userId}` and
  //      `${principal.userId}` are the three live spellings and all three pass;
  //   5. the prefix constant copied into a variable first: `const p =
  //      CONFIRM_KEY_PREFIX;` and then `` `${p}${jti}` ``;
  //   6. the OAuth library's own keys (`grant:`, `token:`, `client:`), which
  //      live in `node_modules`, outside every entry in `SCAN_ROOTS`.
  //
  // A rule believed to prove more than it does is worse than one whose limits
  // are written down.
  //
  // ONE ENTRY LEFT THIS LIST IN PHASE 11, and the departure is recorded rather
  // than silently dropped. The login failure counter in `src/auth/login-handler.ts`
  // used to be keyed by the connecting SOURCE and built from bare literals, so
  // this rule could not see it at all; the list said so, and told Phase 11 not
  // to assume otherwise. Phase 11 re-keyed that counter to the TARGET's derived
  // user id behind a prefix constant, so this rule now does see it, and it
  // passes because the id sits immediately after the prefix. Audit row S5. It
  // is the first thing under `src/auth/` this rule has ever reached.
  //
  // THE SHAPE. An interpolation whose whole content is an upper-case identifier
  // containing one of eight store words and ending in `PREFIX`, NOT followed by
  // an interpolation of `userId` with at most one member access in front of it.
  //
  // THE LOOKAHEAD STARTS ON THE VERY NEXT CHARACTER, and that is load-bearing
  // rather than terse. It carried a leading `\s*` when it was written, which is
  // outside the interpolation and therefore matches LITERAL characters of the
  // template: `` `${CONFIRM_KEY_PREFIX} ${userId}:${jti}` `` passed, and so did
  // the same thing with a newline. Both build a key with a space or a newline
  // between the prefix and the id — not the key this rule says is required. The
  // concrete bytes were spelled here with the confirmation prefix's version
  // segment in them and went stale when that prefix moved, so the shape is
  // described rather than quoted. No
  // cross-user leak, since the id is still there, but the rule proved less than
  // its own first paragraph claimed, and that paragraph is the thing a reader
  // relies on. Dropped, so anything at all between the prefix and the id fires.
  // This only ever refuses more. `test/forbidden-tokens.test.ts` carries the
  // space and newline cases as must-fire rows so the gap cannot reopen quietly.
  //
  // THE MEMBER-ACCESS CHAIN IS BOUNDED AT THREE, NOT AT ONE, AND THE REASON IS
  // THE FAILURE MODE RATHER THAN TASTE. At one, a perfectly correct key written
  // `` `${STAGING_PREFIX}${ctx.actor.userId}/...` `` FIRED. `.husky/pre-commit`
  // runs under `set -e`, so a false positive here does not refuse one line: it
  // refuses every commit in the repository, including commits on work that has
  // nothing to do with keys — which is the failure D-21 and the armed-last
  // ordering exist to avoid, arriving later and by a different door. Widening
  // the chain admits nothing a one-deep chain did not already admit: the
  // literal spelling `userId` is still required at the end, so a key with no
  // user in it fires exactly as before. It is bounded rather than left open for
  // the reason both upper-case runs are bounded, and measured on the same
  // 200,000-character adversarial input.
  //
  // A DEEPER OR COMPUTED PATH IS STILL A FALSE POSITIVE, and the remedy is to
  // bind the id to a local first -- `const userId = a.b.c.d.userId;` -- rather
  // than to widen this rule again. A call in the path, `${resolve(x).userId}`,
  // is the same case and the same remedy.
  // Both upper-case runs are bounded at 40 rather than left unbounded: that is
  // what makes a 200,000-character adversarial input return in 0 ms, and it is
  // not a tidiness knob. The MIME boundary constant in the message-assembly
  // module is the near-miss, and the store-word filter is what keeps it clean
  // WITHOUT a path exclusion -- an exclusion there would drop the logging,
  // fan-out and write rules on that module too.
  //
  // ARMED LAST, ON PHASE 9'S PRECEDENT. It fired on four real lines when Phase
  // 10 opened. `.husky/pre-commit` runs under `set -e`, so arming it before all
  // four key expressions were reshaped would have refused every commit in the
  // repository, including commits on unrelated work. It landed on a tree where

A key with no user segment is a key any signed-in caller can name, so one person's object becomes reachable through another person's request, and nothing fails on the way in: the store returns the object it was asked for. Interpolate the user id straight after the prefix constant, and take it from the signed-in principal -- never from the key, the token or the id being checked, because those are caller-supplied and a caller who chooses the segment chooses whose data to read. If this fired on something that is not a store key, rename the constant so it no longer reads as one.

  // THE RULE. The one-time reservation for a confirmation is keyed on the
  // CALLER's own user id and on nothing else. This rule bans the one
  // alternative a reader is actually tempted by: the id carried inside the
  // confirmation payload, reached as a `.u` member in the reservation's own
  // argument list.
  //
  // WHY THE TWO ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ALWAYS EQUAL.
  // Audit row T1 is closed by TWO layers, and this is the second of them
  // (D-12, corrected by measurement in plan 10-04). Layer one is the user
  // check inside `verifyConfirmation`, which refuses a caller presenting
  // somebody else's confirmation. Layer two is this key: a caller who ever
  // reached the reservation holding somebody else's confirmation burns a slot
  // under their OWN id, so the owner's confirmation still spends. Reading the
  // payload here would collapse layer two onto layer one -- the slot would
  // belong to whoever the token names, which is audit row T1 exactly as it
  // was, where a refused commit spends the owner's slot and the owner must
  // preview again.
  //
  // WHY A RULE RATHER THAN A TEST. No test in this repository can tell the two
  // expressions apart. Layer one guarantees they are equal by the time the
  // reservation runs, so every execution this project can produce agrees.
  // Reaching the reservation with a mismatched pair would need layer one
  // disabled, and the only way to do that from a test is a test-only path into
  // the verifier -- a back door that would cost more than it bought. So the
  // swap is a one-word edit that reads as more correct, removes a layer, and
  // leaves the whole suite green. That is the same hazard class as the D-20
  // colon, and it gets the same answer.
  //
  // WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. Every one of these makes the swap and fires nothing:

  //   4. an argument list longer than 200 characters, or one carrying a `)`
  //      of its own -- a nested call among the arguments ends the span early,
  //      and the rule then sees nothing past it;

The reservation keyed on the caller means a caller who ever reached it holding somebody else's confirmation burns a slot under their own id, and the owner's confirmation still spends.

  // those three is now guarded.

  // readers, so the count's `missing` arm could never fire again -- and this
  // project's own enforcement rule is that a constraint whose missing arm
  // cannot fire looks exactly like a constraint that was never added. The count
  // had to become a ban or become a lie about itself. The two are not
  // interchangeable and the direction of the change is one-way: a count asks
  // "exactly these files", a ban asks "no file", and only the second is true
  // once the thing being counted has been deleted.
  //
  // WHY A READ OF A DELETED BINDING IS REFUSED AT ALL. Because the name coming
  // back is the singular identity coming back. Nothing supplies these two
  // values now, so a read of one resolves to nothing and would fail at run
  // time -- but the failure worth preventing is the quiet one, a session
  // reasoning about a single owner again on a server that serves whoever signed
  // in. The compiler is the FIRST check (Phase 9 D-14): the three names left the
  // shared binding type, so a stray reader does not compile, and
  // `test/env-narrowing.test.ts` pins that with expect-error lines. This is the
  // SECOND, and it exists because the compiler sees types while this sees TEXT.
  // A cast, a comment, or a file the typecheck never reaches gets past one and
  // not the other. Neither sees everything.
  //
  // WHY THIS SCOPE. The source tree only. The sentence carries over from the
  // count's docstring unchanged in substance: tests are not a credential path,
  // and the scanner's own test file spells the read verbatim as a sample and is
  // skipped by path for every rule.
  //
  // WHY THE LOGIN GATE'S SECRET IS LEFT OUT (Phase 9 D-28). It is not an Apple
  // credential and it gates the authorize form rather than an account. It was
  // out of the count for that reason and it stays out of the ban for the same
  // one; a row in the scanner's test pins it as a miss so nobody folds it in.

  // of the environment object; an index access with the name written as a
  // string; an alias of the environment object under another name; a

  // the environment object, which puts the cast keyword between the name and
  // the dot.
  //
  // THE MEMBER ACCESS MATCHES WHAT `PROPS_READER` MATCHES (code review WR-03),

 * on the command line recorded through the in-memory duplex -- discriminating
 * exactly where a regex is not, because it reads the mailbox that was actually
 * written rather than the shape of the line that wrote it. Two further shapes
 * are outside this pattern's reach: a command line carrying a literal tag rather
 * than an interpolated one, and the command word held in a variable and handed

 * PROSE DISCIPLINE, FOR EVERY MODULE ADDED TO `src/` AFTER THIS RULE. The scope
 * is the whole source tree and the walk happens on every commit, so a comment in
 * a module written months from now is scanned by this rule too. ./.claude/CLAUDE.md
 * § 1 records the hazard in its own words: a source comment spelling a banned
 * token out would fail the very check it was trying to explain. So describe this
 * command BY ROLE -- "the write", "placing the message into the drafts folder",
 * "a write that failed must not delete" -- and never by name, exactly as
 * `src/mail/socket.ts` describes the banned transport paths by role and points
 * here for the spelling. Do NOT rely on this pattern being case-sensitive and a
 * comment happening to be lowercase: that is luck rather than a guarantee, and
 * the failure it produces is a pre-commit rejection in the middle of an
 * unrelated plan, with no obvious cause and a tempting one-character "fix" to
 * the pattern.
 *
 * Case-sensitive, and anchored on the command's CONSTRUCTION rather than on the
 * word alone, for the reason `DAV_FETCH_CALL` gives one constant up. Three
 * modules already discuss this command in prose; `MAX_APPEND_LITERAL_BYTES` and
 * `DRAFT_APPEND_FLAGS` merely contain the same six letters; and the response
 * code the server sends back on success carries them as a prefix, so a pattern
 * keyed on the spelling alone would ban reading the answer to the very command
 * it protects -- the same trap `non-peeking-fetch-item` is anchored against. The
 * two alternatives are the only two ways a command line is built in this
 * codebase: after an interpolated tag, and at the head of a quoted string handed
 * to the generic sender.
 *
 * Collected from `src/` only. `test/append.test.ts` asserts the command line

 * WHY A COUNT. Zero is a violation as two is. A second site is a second way to
 * reach a mailbox opened for changing, arriving without a decision; that is
 * the PITFALLS #32 failure, where every read call site ends up one argument
 * away from changing mail. Zero means the mutating path was deleted, renamed
 * or emptied. That direction is the quieter one: nothing fails on the way out,
 * because the tests that covered the deleted code leave with it.
 *
 * WHY THE OWNER FILE MAY HOLD ONLY ONE. The collector takes EVERY match with a
 * fresh global copy per file, as the confirm-line count's does, and the
 * checker allows the owner one entry. With `search()` a file contributes at
 * most one entry, so a second open inside `src/mail/service.ts` itself would
 * pass. It must not: "one site" is about sites, not files.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. Three shapes are outside this pattern's reach:
 *
 *   1. a command line carrying a literal tag rather than an interpolated one;
 *   2. the command word held in a variable and handed to the generic sender in
 *      `src/mail/imap-session.ts`;
 *   3. a lowercase command word. The wire is case-insensitive, so a lowercase
 *      open works on the server. The pattern stays case-sensitive anyway,
 *      because a case-insensitive one would fire on ordinary strings that begin
 *      with the English word "Select" followed by a space.
 *
 * COMMENTS. The collector matches against the file with its comment LINES
 * blanked (`withoutCommentLines`), so a commented-out open does not satisfy the
 * count. Without that, deleting the real open and leaving a comment that quotes
 * it would keep the count at one and the missing arm quiet, which is the exact
 * quiet loss that arm exists to catch. Only whole-line comments are blanked: a
 * line whose first non-space characters are `//`, and a block comment that
 * starts a line, up to its close. One shape is left, and it still counts: a
 * comment trailing code on the same line (`foo(); // was ...`). Telling that
 * `//` from one inside a string or a regex literal needs a real tokenizer, and
 * a tokenizer that misreads one would hide real code, which is worse than the
 * gap. A block comment opened after code on a line is not tracked either, so
 * its following lines count as code.
 *
 * The one legitimate site is held one layer up instead, by the byte-exact
 * assertion on the recorded open line in `test/triage.test.ts`, which reads
 * what was actually sent rather than the shape of the source that sent it. A
 * count believed to prove more than it does is worse than one whose limits are
 * written down.
 *
 * PROSE DISCIPLINE. The scope is the whole source tree and the walk runs on
 * every commit, so describe this command BY ROLE in `src/` -- "opened in the
 * mutating form", "the mutating open" -- and never by name followed by an
 * argument. A whole-line comment no longer counts here (see COMMENTS), but a
 * trailing one still does, and the write's count one constant up still reads
 * comments. Describing it by role keeps every one of those quiet.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. The same anchoring as `APPEND_COMMAND`: after an interpolated tag,
 * or at the head of a quoted string, case-sensitive, with a trailing space.
 * Those are the only two ways a command line is built in this codebase.
 * Measured before arming: this pattern matched nothing under `src/`, `test/`
 * or `scripts/`, so its missing arm would have fired the moment it existed
 * without a site. It was armed in the same commit as the site.
 *
 * Collected from `src/` only. Tests and fixtures spell the command on purpose,
 * to script the server's side and to assert the recorded line byte for byte,
 * and a fixture is not a code path.
 *
 * No `g` flag. The collector builds its own global copy per file, because a
 * shared global regex carries `lastIndex` from one file into the next.

 * (phase 20, D-05). That module exports narrow verbs and never a session.
 * Everything else that needs a message changed calls one of those verbs. The
 * service module defines the orchestrator and imports nothing from itself, so
 * it is not an importer and is not counted.
 *
 * WHY A COUNT. A second importer is a second place that can hold a mailbox
 * opened for changing and do whatever it likes in it, arriving without a
 * decision. A tool that imported the orchestrator directly would skip the
 * verbs, and the verbs are where "one message, one flag, no body fetch" lives.
 * Zero importers means the verbs module was deleted, renamed or rewired, and
 * nothing fails on the way out: the tests that covered it leave with it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. Each of these reaches the orchestrator and fires
 * nothing:
 *
 *   1. a namespace import of the service module (`import * as s from ...`),
 *      followed by a call through it;
 *   2. a star re-export of the service module (`export * from ...`) in another
 *      module, with the orchestrator imported from there;
 *   3. a dynamic import of the service module (`await import(...)`);
 *   4. an alias: a module path alias that does not end in `/service`, or the
 *      orchestrator re-bound to another name inside the owner and handed on.
 *
 * A renamed binding in the braces (`withMutatingMailbox as open`) IS seen,
 * because the orchestrator's own name is still spelled inside them.
 *
 * COMMENTS. As for the mutating open: the collector matches against the file
 * with its comment LINES blanked, so an import that was deleted and left
 * quoted in a comment does not satisfy the count. A comment trailing code on
 * the same line still counts; see `MUTATING_OPEN_COMMAND`, COMMENTS, for why
 * that one is left.
 *
 * A named re-export (`export { withMutatingMailbox } from "./service"`) IS
 * seen too. It is the cheapest way round an import-only count: one barrel line
 * anywhere under `src/`, then an ordinary import from the barrel. The barrel
 * line is itself the second importer, so it is counted as one.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. An import or export statement that names either orchestrator
 * inside its braces, from a module path ending in `/service` with an optional
 * TypeScript or JavaScript extension. A type-only one matches too, and so does
 * one spread over several lines. It matched nothing under `src/`, `test/` or
 * `scripts/` before the owner existed, and it was armed in the same commit.
 * Widening it to the export form also matched nothing new under `src/`.

 *
 * WHY A COUNT. The embedder is where text from the person's mail leaves the
 * Worker for the model. One reader keeps that to one place, with one model and
 * one shape check, and it is the place a later phase looks when it asks what
 * mail text went where. Zero is a violation too: a deleted reader guards
 * nothing, and nothing fails on the way out.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. A member read (`env.AI`, `this.env.AI`, `env?.AI`, `env!.AI`) or
 * a bracket read with the name as a string (`env["AI"]`). Narrower than the
 * vector binding's count on purpose: the two letters appear as a whole word in
 * ordinary strings ("Workers AI"), and a whole-word count would fire on those.
 *
 * COMMENTS. Matched with comment lines blanked, as the other counts are, so a
 * commented-out read cannot keep the missing arm quiet.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. A destructured environment (`const { AI } = env`), an

 * environment object under another name (`const e = env; e.AI`). All three
 * are deliberate evasions, not mistakes.

 * WHY THE TWO FILES ARE EXEMPT. `src/agent/recall-ledger.ts` defines the kind

 * for, and answers the slot word for it. Neither ever asks for a page. The
 * exemption is part of the count and not a path exclusion, so both files stay

 * is the owner's, answers every other grant with a 401 it builds itself, and

 * reads the grant serves every grant. "No second reader" is trivially true of

 * added for convenience is a second place that decides who the caller is, and
 * the two drift. Zero is as much a violation as two.
 *
 * TWO ARMS. The first is the props member read off an identifier named `ctx`,
 * bounded as whole words, with the optional-chaining form and the non-null mark
 * included. The second is a call to the auth context reader,
 * `getMcpAuthContext`. Phase 9 D-08 says the factory never calls it, and spike
 * S1 showed it is the other way to reach the same props. The second arm goes
 * beyond D-22's wording. It only refuses more, and it had zero hits under `src/`
 * when it was added. To drop it, delete that one arm here and its two rows in
 * the test.
 *
 * THE MEMBER ACCESS MATCHES WHAT THE ACCOUNT-BINDING BAN MATCHES (code review
 * WR-03, and see `mail-secret-read` in the list above -- that one was a count
 * beside this one until phase 13 deleted the binding it counted the readers of,
 * and the shared member access outlived the count). The two were written in the
 * same phase and disagreed for no
 * reason: this one allowed white space around the dot and an optional question
 * mark, that one allowed neither. Both now allow white space, a new line, an
 * optional question mark and an optional non-null mark on either side of the
 * dot. THE MARK OWNS THE WHITE SPACE BEHIND IT, as one optional group, for the
 * reason the environment-write rule spells out at length further up this file:
 * split into two optional white-space runs, a space before the dot could be
 * taken by either, which is two ways to match every link and a cost that
 * doubles per link. Do not split that group into two optional pieces.
 *
 * The non-null mark is the one that mattered here: a context parameter
 * typed as possibly absent is written that way by the compiler's own prompting,
 * and there is no compiler backstop on this count, so a second reader spelled
 * that way was invisible. Keep the two member accesses identical. A difference
 * between them is a difference nobody decided.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. Each of these reads the props and fires nothing:
 *
 *   1. props destructured from the context (`const { props } = ctx`);
 *   2. the context under another name (`context.props`, `executionCtx.props`);
 *   3. a props read hidden behind a helper that lives in the owner file and is
 *      called from elsewhere;
 *   4. a type cast in parentheses around the context, which puts the cast
 *      keyword between the name and the dot.
 *
 * A computed member (`ctx["props"]`) is a fifth. A count believed to prove
 * more than it does is worse than one whose limits are written down.
 *
 * NEVER MATCH THE BARE WORD. The DAV library uses `props` all over `src/dav/`
 * for PROPFIND results (`response.props`, `props.displayname`). A rule that
 * fires there would be narrowed by the next person in a hurry, and a narrowed
 * rule is how this guard would quietly leave.
 *
 * THIS COUNT IS NOT THE PROPS CONSTRUCTOR'S COUNT, AND THE TWO ARE DIFFERENT
 * QUESTIONS (Phase 9 D-22, settled by Phase 11). This one counts files that
 * READ the grant's props off the execution context. `PRINCIPAL_CONSTRUCTOR`
 * below counts sites that MINT a principal from a props object. A reader can
 * hand the props anywhere; a minter can be handed props from anywhere. Neither
 * question answers the other, which is why the constructor got a count of its
 * own rather than an arm on this one.
 *
 * The note that used to sit here asked Phase 11 for that arm, on the ground
 * that nothing called the constructor yet and a count of its callers would fail
 * on zero. All three claims stopped being true when Phase 11 landed. The
 * constructor now has exactly TWO callers — `src/mcp/api-handler.ts`, which
 * builds a principal from a stored grant, and `src/auth/login-handler.ts`,
 * which builds one from values a person just typed — so an arm on a one-owner
 * rule was the wrong shape as well as the wrong place. See
 * `PRINCIPAL_CONSTRUCTOR` for the argument that there are legitimately two.
 *
 * Comments count. In every file under `src/` except the owner, write "the
 * grant's props" and never the spelled read. No `g` flag: `scan()` uses
 * `String.prototype.search`, which takes the first match only.

 * principal module defines the reader and imports nothing, so it is not an
 * importer and is not counted. Everything else that needs to act for a

 *

 * fails on the way out: the tests that covered the deleted code leave with it.
 * "No third importer" is trivially true of a tree with no importer at all. A
 * third importer is the other failure: a second thing in this project that can
 * read a password, arriving without a decision. Zero, one and three are all
 * violations. Only two passes, and only these two.
 *
 * WHY THERE ARE TWO OWNERS. Every count above has one owner. This one has two
 * because the password is spent in two places that cannot share code. One
 * writes the mail login onto the socket. The other builds the DAV
 * authorization header. `src/mail` and `src/dav` may not import each other, so
 * neither can borrow the other's reader. The missing arm therefore fires once
 * PER absent owner and names that owner, not once when the list is empty.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. Each of these reaches the reader and fires nothing:
 *
 *   1. a namespace import of the principal module (`import * as p from ...`),
 *      followed by `p.passwordOf(...)`;
 *   2. a re-export of the reader through another module, imported from there;

 *      reader re-bound to another name inside an owner file and handed on.
 *
 * A renamed binding in the braces (`passwordOf as read`) IS seen, because the
 * reader's own name is still spelled inside them. A count believed to prove
 * more than it does is worse than one whose limits are written down.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. An import statement that names the reader inside its braces, from
 * a module path ending in `/principal` with an optional TypeScript or
 * JavaScript extension. A type-only import matches too, and so does an import
 * spread over several lines, because the brace span is "anything but a closing
 * brace". It matched nothing under `src/` at the Phase 9 base. It was armed
 * only after both chains landed (Phase 9 D-25): armed after one, the hook would
 * have refused every commit of the other.

 * store key is scoped by, and it is `src/principal.ts`. ISO-05 rule 10 states
 * it in prose -- "no second function that turns an address into a user id may
 * exist anywhere" -- and D-18 makes it mechanical. Everything that needs the id
 * reads it off the signed-in principal; nothing computes one for itself.
 *
 * WHY A COUNT RATHER THAN A NEGATIVE. Two producers is the loud failure: they
 * drift, and the day they disagree one person becomes two users or two people
 * become one. A user whose id changed loses every staged attachment and every
 * pending confirmation in a single deploy; two users who collapsed onto one id
 * read each other's. Zero producers is the quiet failure, and it is the one a
 * negative cannot see at all: "no second hashing site" is trivially true of a
 * tree with no hashing site left. A choke-point that was deleted, renamed, or
 * rewritten into a form this count cannot see guards nothing, and nothing goes
 * red on the way out, because the tests that covered it leave with it.
 *
 * WHY THE ANCHOR NAMES THE ENCODER, AND WHY A BARE DIGEST COUNT DOES NOT WORK.
 * There are three Web Crypto digest call sites under `src/` and two of them are
 * legitimate non-owners: `src/confirm.ts` hashes a canonical change and two
 * change hashes through `TOKEN_ENCODER`, and `src/auth/login-handler.ts` hashes
 * the login gate's own submitted secret through a function-local lower-case
 * encoder. None of them hashes an address. A bare digest count would report
 * three owners and -- because the pre-commit hook runs this scanner under
 * `set -e` -- would refuse every commit in the repository, including commits on
 * unrelated work. So the anchor is the digest call TOGETHER WITH the module
 * scope encoder's name, and two properties of it are load-bearing rather than
 * cosmetic:
 *
 *   1. THE WORD BOUNDARY IS MANDATORY. The encoder's name is a SUBSTRING of
 *      the confirm module's. Without a boundary on both sides the anchor
 *      matches there too and the count reports a second owner.
 *   2. THERE IS NO CASE-INSENSITIVE FLAG. The login gate's encoder differs
 *      only in letter case, and a case-insensitive anchor reaches it.
 *
 * Both were measured in both directions before this count was armed. Every
 * unsafe variant reports at least one owner too many, and every one of them
 * freezes the repository. The test block carries a must-not-match row for each
 * of the five non-owner digest lines, so a broken anchor fails there first.
 *
 * WHY THE LOGIN GATE'S SECRET AND THE CHANGE HASHES ARE NOT FOLDED IN. Phase 9
 * D-28 set the precedent when it left the login gate's own secret out of the
 * mail-secret count: one count answering two different questions answers
 * neither well. This count answers "how many things produce a user id", and
 * neither a submitted secret nor a canonical change is an address.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. Each of these turns an address into an id and fires
 * nothing:
 *
 *   1. the encoder renamed -- `const E = new TextEncoder()` and then
 *      `E.encode(address)`. That is the price of anchoring on a name, and it
 *      is written down here rather than hidden. The tell is the gap between
 *      the digest population and the anchored count;
 *   2. an encoder constructed inline at the digest call, with no module-scope
 *      constant at all;
 *   3. an address hashed by a library rather than by Web Crypto;
 *   4. a digest call whose arguments are spread over more than 200 characters
 *      between the opening parenthesis and the encoder name. The bound is what
 *      keeps the match linear; it is not a licence to reformat past it;
 *   5. WHAT the site hashes. This sees an encoder name, not an address. The
 *      owner could start hashing something else entirely and the count would
 *      still say one. `test/key-shapes.test.ts` is what holds the OUTPUT to
 *      the spec; this holds the number of producers.
 *
 * A count believed to prove more than it does is worse than one whose limits
 * are written down.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. A Web Crypto digest call, then at most 200 characters that do not
 * cross a closing parenthesis, then the encoder's name as a whole word. The
 * character class matches newlines, so a call formatted across several lines is
 * still one match; it cannot cross a `)`, so the anchor cannot reach past the
 * end of the call's argument list. No `g` flag: `scan()` uses
 * `String.prototype.search`, which takes the first match only.

 * A call to the props-backed principal constructor, permitted in exactly two
 * files of the source tree.
 *
 * THE RULE. Exactly two files under `src/` turn a props object into a
 * principal: `src/mcp/api-handler.ts` and `src/auth/login-handler.ts`. The
 * principal module DEFINES the constructor and is not a caller, so it is not
 * counted. Everything else that needs to act for somebody is handed the
 * principal the door already built and never mints one.
 *
 * WHY A COUNT RATHER THAN A NEGATIVE. A third minting site is a third place in
 * this project that can turn a props object into a live session, arriving
 * without a decision — and the props it is handed need not be the props the
 * door checked. Zero is the other failure and the quieter one: one caller gone
 * means an identity path was deleted, moved, or rewritten to get identity some
 * other way, and nothing fails on the way out, because the tests that covered
 * the deleted code leave with it. "No third caller" is trivially true of a tree
 * with no caller at all. Zero, one, and three are all violations. Only two
 * passes, and only these two.
 *
 * WHY THERE ARE TWO OWNERS. The count above this one has a single owner. This
 * one has two because the two callers build from two different SOURCES and
 * neither can borrow the other's:
 *
 *   1. The door builds from a STORED grant's props, which the OAuth provider
 *      decrypted and put on the execution context. That is the serving path.
 *   2. The login handler builds from values the person JUST TYPED, before any
 *      grant exists, because that is the only way to hand a principal to the
 *      session runner and prove the credentials at Apple. It cannot take one
 *      from the door — there is no grant yet — and it cannot hand a look-alike
 *      to the password reader either: that reader answers only the very object
 *      this constructor built, so a hand-made stand-in reaches nothing.
 *
 * The missing arm therefore fires once PER absent owner and names that owner,
 * not once when the list is empty. This is the same shape as the password
 * count, for the same reason, and NOT the shape of the one-owner counts.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT AN ARM ON `PROPS_READER`. That count's own note used to ask for
 * one. The two ask different questions — that one counts files that READ the
 * props off the context, this one counts sites that MINT a principal from a
 * props object — and folding them together would make one count answer both
 * and neither well. Phase 9 D-28 set that precedent when it left the login
 * gate's secret out of the mail-secret count.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES SEE that a reader might not expect: a call through a namespace
 * import. The word boundary sits on the constructor's own name, and a member
 * access puts a dot in front of it rather than a word character, so a namespace
 * call is matched and counted like any other. That only refuses more.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE. Each of these mints a principal and fires nothing:
 *
 *   1. the constructor RE-BOUND to another name and called through it, whether
 *      by a renamed import, by an assignment to a local, or by a parameter it
 *      is passed as. The name is the whole anchor, and this is the price of
 *      anchoring on a name — written down here rather than hidden;
 *   2. a re-export of the constructor through another module, imported from
 *      there under a different name;
 *   3. a dynamic import of the principal module, then a call off the resolved
 *      namespace under a different name;
 *   4. a computed call: the name reached as a string through square brackets,
 *      or through a table of constructors keyed by anything at all;
 *   5. a call with a COMMENT between the name and its opening parenthesis.
 *      White space of any kind, a line break included, IS matched — only a
 *      comment breaks the run.
 *
 * Two more shapes are worth naming because they are the tempting ones rather
 * than the exotic ones: a WRAPPER inside one of the two owner files, exported
 * and called from a third file — the call this count sees still lives in an
 * owner, so the count still reads two — and a principal built by hand as an
 * object literal, which this cannot see at all and which the password reader
 * refuses at run time instead. A count believed to prove more than it does is
 * worse than one whose limits are written down.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. The constructor's name as a whole word followed by an opening
 * parenthesis, NOT preceded by the declaration keyword — that keyword in front
 * is what tells a definition from a call, and it is why the principal module's
 * own definition is not counted as a caller there. The lookbehind is bounded at
 * eight white-space characters so a definition split across lines by the
 * formatter is still recognised as one; it is bounded rather than open for the
 * same reason every other bound in this file is. A plain named import is not
 * matched, because an import does not put a parenthesis after the name. No `g`
 * flag: `scan()` uses `String.prototype.search`, which takes the first match
 * only, so a file that calls the constructor twice is one entry.
 *
 * Comments count. In every file under `src/`, describe the construction in
 * plain words unless you mean the call — a comment that spells the name with a
 * parenthesis after it in a third file fails the commit hook in the middle of
 * unrelated work. Naming it with no parenthesis, as both owners and the door's
 * prose already do, is always safe.

 * The definition of the one function that composes the human-facing line.
 *
 * THE RULE. One composer, at one definition site, so five call sites cannot
 * phrase five sentences that drift apart. The sentence a user reads before they
 * agree to a destructive change is the one thing the confirmation token cannot
 * bind -- it is written from the preview payload, by a model that is reading
 * stranger-authored content in the same context window -- so CONF-04 moves the
 * writing of it into this server. Two composers is two registers, and the drift
 * between them is invisible until somebody reads two transcripts side by side.
 *
 * WHY A COUNT RATHER THAN A SCOPED NEGATIVE. The standing answer every count in
 * this file gives. The natural spelling would be "ban a composer outside the
 * confirm module", and this scanner has no per-rule path exemption: `EXCLUDED`
 * skips a file for EVERY rule. Buying that exemption by path would silently drop
 * the logging ban and the account-binding ban on the one module that holds the
 * confirmation gate.
 *
 * WHAT THE COUNT SEES THAT A NEGATIVE CANNOT. Zero is a violation. A composer
 * that was deleted, renamed or inlined back into its call sites guards nothing,
 * and that direction is far easier to miss, because nothing fails on the way
 * out: the tests covering the deleted code are deleted with it. Five phases --
 * contacts, collections, RSVP, mail triage, draft editing -- inherit this
 * sentence rather than re-deciding it, and each of them is a session that could
 * lose it without a single assertion going red.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT AND CANNOT SEE. Five shapes get past this rule, and naming
 * them is what stops a later reader believing it proves more than it does. The
 * first four each produce a second human-facing sentence and fire nothing:
 *
 *   1. a second composer bound to a `const` ARROW rather than declared. No
 *      declaration keyword follows, so nothing matches -- and this is the one
 *      most likely to arrive by accident, because it is a style choice rather
 *      than an evasion;
 *   2. a line assembled INLINE at a tool shaper as a template literal, which is
 *      the shortest route and therefore the tempting one;
 *   3. a RE-EXPORT under an alias, imported from there under a different name;
 *   4. a helper that takes the composed line and REWRITES it before it reaches
 *      the response -- the count sees one composer and the user reads something
 *      else.
 *
 * The fifth runs the other way and is the sharper one, because it defeats the
 * arm this rule exists for rather than the arm it shares with a plain ban:
 *
 *   5. a COMMENT satisfies the presence arm. This pattern matches text, not
 *      code, so any line under `src/confirm.ts` that names the composer with the
 *      declaration keyword in front of it -- in prose, in a docstring, in a
 *      commented-out draft -- makes the collected list non-empty. Delete, rename
 *      or inline the real definition after that and `composers.length === 0` is
 *      false, `confirm-line-composer-missing` never fires, and the scan passes
 *      with no composer in the tree -- which is precisely the failure direction
 *      the paragraph above says this count exists to catch. No such comment
 *      exists today. Do not rely on the zero arm alone, and do not write that
 *      comment: name the composer WITHOUT the keyword in front of it, exactly as
 *      the `does not see a CALL or an IMPORT` samples do -- which is also why
 *      this bullet describes the shape instead of quoting it.
 *
 * A SIXTH SHAPE USED TO GET PAST AND NO LONGER DOES. Two definitions in the
 * OWNER file both passed, because the collector used `String.prototype.search`
 * and a file could contribute at most one entry: two composers in
 * `src/confirm.ts` produced one entry, that entry was the owner, and the checker
 * skipped it. "One composer, at one definition site" was then false with the
 * scan green. The collector now counts EVERY match in a file and the checker
 * reports the second and later occurrences in the owner, so the count is a count
 * in both files and within one.
 *
 * What actually holds those four is named here rather than left implied: the
 * byte-exact line table in `test/confirm.test.ts`, which pins every sentence the
 * composer can produce and would fail the moment a second register appeared in a
 * response; and the fence audit's key-set comparison in
 * `test/dav-fence-audit.test.ts`, which pins the exhaustive key set of both
 * halves of both write shapes, so a second line field has nowhere quiet to land.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. The declaration keyword, whitespace, then the composer's name.
 * Anchoring on the KEYWORD is what makes a call site and an import invisible,
 * and that is load-bearing rather than tidy: every call site lives under the
 * collected scope, so a pattern keyed on the bare name would report the very
 * sites this rule exists to protect and the pre-commit hook would refuse every
 * commit in the repository. White space of any kind is matched, a line break
 * included, so a signature the formatter broke up is still one definition.
 *
 * No `g` flag on the exported constant, and one test asserts the absence. The
 * collector needs every match rather than the first, so it builds its own global
 * copy per file with `new RegExp(CONFIRM_LINE_COMPOSER, "g")`. That is the right
 * way round: a shared global regex carries `lastIndex` between files, so a rule
 * exported with the flag on would silently start matching from wherever the
 * previous file left off.

 * The DAV write modules, and a recorded disposition for every name each of them
 * exports.
 *
 * THE RULE. Three modules under `src/dav/` are declared here because each of
 * them exports, or is about to export, a network-reaching entry point the tool
 * layer can reach. Every name those modules export today carries a disposition:
 * either the exact string `"guarded"`, meaning the name must appear in the
 * `dav-concurrent-request` alternation, or a short prose reason saying why it
 * must not -- which is always the same kind of reason, that the function issues
 * no request at all. A new export in a declared module fails the scan until
 * somebody writes one of those two things down. That is the whole point: "write"
 * is not inferable from a name, so nothing will decide it automatically, and
 * v3.0 adds contact create and update, collection create, rename and delete,
 * event alarms and an invitation reply -- many new entry points, added by hand,
 * across several phases, by several sessions. The probability that every one of
 * them reaches the alternation unprompted is not high.
 *
 * WHY A COUNT RATHER THAN A SCOPED NEGATIVE. The same standing answer every
 * count in this file gives. The natural spelling would be "ban an unguarded
 * export under `src/dav/`, except in the modules that legitimately have one",
 * and this scanner has no per-rule path exemption: `EXCLUDED` skips a file for
 * EVERY rule. Buying that exemption by path would silently drop the logging
 * ban, the eager-load ban, the host-literal count and the fan-out rule itself on
 * the three modules that most need them, since they are the modules holding the
 * account's write path.
 *
 * WHAT THE COUNT SEES THAT A NEGATIVE CANNOT. A manifest that stopped matching
 * anything is a manifest that guards nothing. A declared module that was moved,
 * renamed, or emptied is never walked, its collected export list is empty, and
 * every name here comes back stale -- which is exactly right, and it is the
 * direction that is easier to miss, because nothing fails on the way out: the
 * tests that covered the deleted code are deleted with it. Zero is as much a
 * violation as an unmanifested extra.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT AND CANNOT SEE. `exportedFunctionNames` is a regex over
 * source text rather than a parser -- the file header forbids a dependency
 * outright, because the pre-commit hook runs before anything guarantees
 * `node_modules` is installed -- so four shapes are outside its reach:
 *
 *   1. a RE-EXPORT (`export { getEvent } from "./elsewhere";`). No `function`
 *      keyword follows the `export`, so nothing matches;
 *   2. a `const` ARROW export (`export const getEvent = async () => {};`). Same
 *      reason, and this is the one most likely to arrive by accident, because it
 *      is a style choice rather than an evasion;
 *   3. a name BOUND AND EXPORTED SEPARATELY (`function getEvent() {}` on one
 *      line, `export { getEvent };` on another). The `export` and the `function`
 *      are never adjacent;
 *   4. a MODULE-LOCAL function that is nonetheless a fan-out entry point. Named
 *      concretely rather than left abstract: `pagedEvents` and `collectFrom` in
 *      `src/dav/calendar.ts` are both on the alternation and both invisible
 *      here, because neither is exported. The alternation covers them; this
 *      manifest cannot, and an export list is not a call-site list.
 *
 * What makes the regex SUFFICIENT rather than merely convenient is a narrower
 * fact about the tree as it stands: every export of all three declared modules
 * that is a FUNCTION is a plain `function` declaration. VALUE exports do exist
 * -- `MAX_RANGE_DAYS`, `MAX_SLOT_RANGE_DAYS`, `SLOT_GRANULARITY_MINUTES` and
 * `UNOBSERVED_DELIVERY` in `src/dav/calendar.ts`, `CONTACT_TERM_MAX_LENGTH` in
 * `src/dav/contacts.ts` -- and the reader does not see any of them, which is
 * correct, because a number is not an entry point and a manifest entry for one
 * would be a disposition nobody can act on. A function bound to a `const` arrow
 * would be invisible in exactly the same way and would NOT be correct, which is
 * gap 2 above.
 *
 * This paragraph claimed the wider fact -- that every export of the declared
 * modules is a plain `function` declaration -- and that was false the day it was
 * written, by five exports. A reader sent to verify it finds it false in thirty
 * seconds, and both conclusions available from that are wrong: either "the
 * manifest is broken and missing five entries", or "const exports must be
 * covered somehow, since this says there are none". A rule believed to prove
 * more than it does is worse than one whose limits are written down -- and the
 * sentence stating the limit is the last place that can afford to be wrong.
 *
 * TWO ABSENCES, RECORDED AS DECISIONS RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE RE-DERIVED.
 * `src/dav/discovery.ts` and `src/dav/transport.ts` both export names that ARE
 * in the `dav-concurrent-request` alternation -- `resolveDavAccount` and
 * `withRediscovery` in the first, and the transport the second builds -- and
 * neither is declared here. Neither exports a write entry point: their
 * alternation names arrived as READ-path round trips, costed for the request
 * budget rather than for anything they change on the account. Declaring either
 * is a decision a later phase can take, and finding this paragraph is what tells
 * that phase it is a decision rather than a gap.
 *
 * The module list is a JUDGEMENT and not a derivation. If a later phase adds a
 * write entry point to a module on neither list, this constraint does not see
 * it.

The rename and the delete are still ahead, in plans 17-04 and 17-06, and they belong in THIS module beside the create rather than in a sibling: a sibling would be a module on neither list, and a write entry point in a module this manifest does not name is invisible to it.",

/**
 * The write-module manifest, as a pure function over what the walk collected.
 *
 * Same split as every count above, and for the same reason: all three failure
 * directions are exercised against a map rather than against a fixture tree on
 * disk. See the `DAV_WRITE_MODULES` docstring for why this is a manifest at all,
 * and for the four shapes the export reader cannot see.
 *
 * THE SECOND PARAMETER EXISTS FOR ONE REASON AND IT IS NOT CONVENIENCE. The
 * third arm compares the MANIFEST against the ALTERNATION. Both are module-level
 * constants, and every manifest-guarded name is already in the shipped
 * alternation, so on a clean tree no value of `collected` can produce that arm —
 * it would be a rule nothing in the suite could ever observe, which is exactly
 * the failure ./.claude/CLAUDE.md's Enforcement section names: a constraint whose
 * arm can never fire looks identical to a constraint that was never added.
 * Substituting the manifest lets a test drive that arm with a fabricated entry
 * whose guarded name the alternation genuinely does not carry.
 *
 * ONLY THE HAND-WRITTEN SIDE IS SUBSTITUTABLE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
 * There is no alternation parameter and none may be added:
 * `davAlternationNames()` is called below with no argument, so the third arm
 * always measures the rule that actually ships, even when driven from a
 * fabricated manifest. Exclusion is by PATH in this project and never by
 * weakening a pattern; this is the same discipline applied to a checker.
 *
 * WHAT THE PRODUCTION CALL SITE'S PINNED TEXT DOES NOT PROVE, written down rather
 * than left implied. The suite pins `scan()`'s call as byte-exactly
 * `checkDavWriteCoverage(davWriteExports)` — the accumulator's own identifier, not
 * merely one argument — and pins that identifier's occurrence count at three. That
 * cannot see a narrowing performed INSIDE `exportedFunctionNames`, which the
 * suite's export-reader tests against shipped source hold instead; and it cannot
 * see a declared module added to `EXCLUDED` before the walk reaches it. The second
 * of those is loud rather than quiet: an unwalked module has an empty collected
 * list, so the stale arm fires once per manifest name for it.
