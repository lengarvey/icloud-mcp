// Recall by meaning (Phase 26, RCLL-08, RCLL-10, RCLL-11, RCLL-12).
//
// One tool, `mail_recall`. The caller asks a question in plain words, and the
// answer is the person's own indexed messages that are nearest to it in
// meaning, best first: each one's opaque message id, the time it was indexed,
// and its subject line as it was when indexed. Nothing else.
//
// **The contract is SEED-006 D-1, and the answer is shaped so it cannot be read
// as anything stronger.** Recall is ranked and best-effort. An empty answer
// means nothing scored high enough, never that no such mail exists. So the
// answer holds no number at all: no score, which would read as confidence; no
// count or total, which would read as completeness; no rank, which the order
// already gives; and no coverage date, which would read as "complete since".
// The score floor that makes "nothing scored high enough" true lives inside the
// store module, and the score never leaves it.
//
// **The fence.** The ids, the indexed times, the index word and the note are
// this server's own, and sit in the trusted block. Every subject line was
// written by whoever sent the mail, and sits in the fenced untrusted block,
// keyed by id. The description carries the untrusted notice.
//
// **No model but the embedder (RCLL-12).** The only model call is the one
// embedding of the query, inside Phase 25's pipeline. Nothing generated is
// returned.
//
// **It opens no mail session and takes no connection lease.** It reads the
// person's own object once and their own part of the index once. The build
// step that follows a mail call comes from plan 26-07's driver, never from this
// handler. The second tool in this module, the backfill at the bottom, is the
// one that does open sessions, one leased session at a time, through its runner
// in src/recall/drive.ts.
//
// **Recall is inherent (owner, 2026-09-27).** Nothing is turned on first, and
// this module has no way to turn it off. The index word is `building` or
// `built` and nothing else.
//
// **A failure is never an empty list (D-09).** If the object, the store or the
// model cannot be reached, the answer is an error with one fixed sentence. An
// empty list there would read as "nothing matched". The caught value is never
// read.
//
// This module contains no logging calls of any kind and must never acquire any.
