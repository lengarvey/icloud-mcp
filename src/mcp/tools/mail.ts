// The mail tool boundary: the error shaper and the registrations.
//
// The untrusted fence itself no longer lives here. D-56 moved it up to
// `../untrusted`, because the framing is a statement about stranger-authored
// text rather than about mail, and the calendar and contacts tools carry
// exactly that text. What this module re-exports below is a compatibility
// surface, not a second copy.
//
// ONE module, every mail registration. D-17 constrains the MCP tool *surface* —
// registered tools with distinct names — not the file count, and D-17 itself
// says the unread tool shares the listing implementation internally rather than
// duplicating it. That sharing is cheapest and least drift-prone inside one
// module, and all of them copy the same analog from `./diagnose.ts` either way:
// exported transport-free shapers, plus a registration function. Later plans
// add registrations here rather than creating siblings.
//
// A sibling file is also the most likely way to break the property phase 2
// verified and this phase inherits: the untrusted fence is called from exactly
// ONE place, and every shaper routes through it.
//
// This module contains no logging calls of any kind and must never acquire any.

 * worst case is three times the per-file cap, which is exactly the ceiling
 * `buildDraft` already measures the assembled message against.
 *
 * **The reads are SERIAL, and a concurrent combinator here would be a bug
 * rather than an optimisation.** The scan rule fires on a combinator wrapped
 * around the session specifically, but the argument behind it — every
 * concurrent operation is a connection slot — applies to the bucket for exactly
 * the same reason, and a serial read of two or three small objects costs
 * nothing worth having.
 *
 * A missing object raises the same refusal an expired token does, and

 * named is gone" are the same situation, and the staging module already returns
 * the missing-object answer for a forged key outside its own prefix rather than

/**
 * Remove the staged objects a successful write consumed. D-81's second layer.
 *
 * **D-81 is THREE layers that fail differently, and all three are named here so
 * a later reader does not remove one believing another covers it.** The staged
 * identifier carries its own expiry and is refused at compose once past it; the
 * object is deleted the moment a compose successfully writes it into the drafts
 * folder; and the bucket's own prefix-scoped lifecycle rule sweeps whatever was
 * abandoned. Defence in depth against different failures, not three spellings
 * of one idea: the first covers a token that leaked into a transcript, the
 * second covers ordinary use, and the third covers everything nobody came back
 * for.
 *
 * **Two ordering rules, and both are the kind a later reader "fixes".**
 *
 * 1. **A write that failed must not delete.** On the presigned ingress the
 *    staged bytes are the only copy, and losing them means re-uploading a file
 *    the user already uploaded once. `appended` is the server's own report, and
 *    nothing else decides it.
 * 2. **A delete that fails AFTER a successful write must not fail the tool
 *    call.** The write happened. The draft is real and sitting in the user's
 *    Drafts folder, and turning a failed cleanup into a failed tool call would
 *    tell the user their draft does not exist. The lifecycle rule is the
 *    backstop for exactly this case, which is what makes swallowing the failure
 *    correct rather than sloppy — **and this paragraph is here because a
 *    swallowed error is the single most likely thing in this phase to be
 *    "corrected" by a reader who has not read D-81.**
 *
 * The swallowed value is never inspected, never logged — there are no logging
 * calls under this tree and there must not be — and gets no error category of
 * its own. D-35's vocabulary stays at four.
 *
 * The loop continues past a failure rather than stopping at it, so one declined
 * delete does not leave every later object for the sweep as well.
 *
 * **D-81's accepted cost, recorded where the delete happens:** the same staged
 * file cannot be attached to two drafts, because the first attach consumes it.
 * Staging it twice is the workaround, and the compose tools say so. That is
 * foreclosed deliberately rather than by oversight.

/**
 * Register the mail tools on a per-request server instance.
 *
 * **No tool here is handed a session gate.** `mail` is the per-person
 * connection lease (Phase 24), built in `createServerFactory` over that
 * request's gate. A tool reaches the gate only through
 * `mail.withConnectionLease`, which takes the person's lease first and hands
 * the gate to the one service call inside. So a tool cannot open an iCloud
 * mail connection without the lease: there is no gate in scope to open one
 * with. That is structural on purpose. PITFALLS #52 names the failure the
 * gate alone could not see, two overlapping REQUESTS from one Apple ID, and
 * ./.claude/CLAUDE.md §3 says why a second connection is costly: iCloud's
 * per-account ceiling is low, undocumented, and locks the user out of Mail.app
 * when it is exhausted.
 *
 * The rules each call site keeps:
 * - The lease is taken after `await principal` and after every id is decoded,
 *   so the cheap refusals still run first and spend nothing, and a refused
 *   principal never reaches the object.
 * - One lease per service call, around that call and nothing else. A tool that
 *   runs two sessions takes it twice, because the lease's expiry is sized to
 *   one session. Staged-file work in R2 is never done under the lease.
 * - The lease is taken outside the orchestrator, never inside
 *   `withMailSession`'s check-and-acquire span.
 *
 * The gate itself is unchanged and still built per request; see
 * `createSessionGate` for why an isolate-wide counter would refuse legitimate
 * concurrent requests. The lease is added beside it, never in its place.
 *
 * `principal` is a promise of who the request acts for, made once per request
 * at the door. Every callback awaits it as the first line of its `try`, and
 * hands the resolved object to each mail function it calls. A refusal is
 * already the auth error, and each `catch` already maps that to
 * `auth_failed`, so an unset secret answers before the lease or the gate is
 * touched and before a socket opens. The await lives HERE and nowhere below:
 * the session orchestrator must not await ahead of its gate (see
 * `withMailSession`).
 *
 * The staging helpers still take the ambient `env`. They reach R2, not mail,
 * and hold no credential.
