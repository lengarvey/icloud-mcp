/**
 * Build the per-request server factory.
 *
 * `extraTools` is the test-injection seam. Production passes nothing, so the
 * shipped tool surface is exactly the tools registered below — two
 * diagnostics, Phase 12's masked account answer, Phase 2's mail tools, and
 * Phase 3's calendar and contacts tools — and nothing that deliberately
 * misbehaves reaches the deployed bundle. A later plan's ordering proof needs
 * a tool that records its own invocation in order to assert the tool layer
 * was never reached on an unauthenticated request; it registers that through
 * this parameter, from a test-only Worker entry, against this same real
 * factory. 01-02-SUMMARY.md records why that test's own name is kept out of
 * this file entirely.
 *
 * `principal` is a PROMISE of who this request acts for, and it comes first
 * because every caller must supply it. The API handler makes it and hands it in
 * by closure, so this file never reads the grant's props. The body below stays
 * synchronous and never awaits it: a rejection here would become a 500 with no
 * challenge. Each tool callback awaits it instead, as the first line of its own
 * `try`, where its own `catch` turns a refusal into `auth_failed`.

    // ACROSS requests, so two overlapping requests from one Apple ID cannot
