// The narrow verbs that change a mailbox, and nothing else (D-05).
//
// This module is the only importer of the mutating orchestrator in
// `./service.ts`, and a scan count holds that in both directions: a second
// importer is a decision on the safety boundary, and zero means this capability
// was deleted. It exports verbs and never a session, a session callback or the
// orchestrator itself. A caller names what it wants done to one message; it
// never gets a mailbox opened for changing to do its own work in.
//
// Two verbs mark one message read, and mark it unread. Two more flag one
// message, and clear its flag. Each sends one flag change and, when the server
// sent no echo, one flags-only re-read.
//
// Each verb checks the one flag it changes against the open's permanent-flags
// list itself, before it sends anything (D-08). The orchestrator records the
// list and takes no mode argument.
//
// Two more move a list of messages from one folder to another, one message at
// a time, in one session. iCloud has no move command, so each message is
// copied, the copy is proven from the server's own reply, the original gets
// the removal mark only if nothing changed since the preview, and then that
// one UID is removed. The only removal anywhere here names one UID whose copy
// was proven, so a failure at any step leaves a duplicate and never a loss.
// Every outcome is judged from a re-read of the source folder afterwards.
//
// Two more move one draft from the drafts folder to Trash (Phase 22). They are
// a move and nothing else: they reuse the move step above, and build no copy,
// no removal mark and no removal of their own. Before the move step they
// re-read the draft's fingerprint and check it still carries the draft flag
// and not the removal mark, so a draft that changed after its preview is
// refused before anything is written. They fetch no body.
//
// Nothing here fetches a message body, and nothing may: a body fetch on a
// mailbox opened for changing is how mail gets marked read by accident.
//
// What a verb reports is what the server sent back about the message after the
// change, never the tagged OK alone (D-11, PITFALLS #33).
//
// This module contains no logging calls of any kind and must never acquire any.

/**
 * What marking one message read or unread produced.
 *
 * `applied: true` carries the seen state the server reported after the change,
 * and where that report came from:
 *
 * - `store-echo`: the untagged reply to the flag change itself.
 * - `read-back`: a flags-only re-read, sent because the flag change had no
 *   reply for this message. RFC 3501 says a server "normally" sends one, which
 *   is not always.
 *
 * `seen` can disagree with what was asked. If it does, that is the answer: the
 * server's word about the message, not the request echoed back.
 *
 * `source: "unconfirmed"` carries no `seen` at all, on purpose. The server
 * accepted the flag change, sent no reply about the message, and then refused
 * the re-read. The change has probably landed, but nothing the server said
 * shows it, so there is no server state to report. Saying "does not exist"
 * here would be false: the message was there a moment ago and was just
 * changed. The caller reports the request, labelled as unconfirmed. Asking
 * again is safe, because setting a flag that is already set changes nothing.
 *
 * `applied: false` means the mailbox opened read-only, or opened without saying
 * it was writable. Nothing was changed. A value rather than an error, following
 * `AppendOutcome`: the call worked and reports a stated reason, and retrying
 * will not help.
