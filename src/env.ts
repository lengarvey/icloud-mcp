       * then revoke their grants. Phase 12's LIFE-05 script is the second half.

       * answers, and it still names him.

// The three narrow secret types are GONE, in one commit with the last thing that
// could spell them (Phase 13, CUT-01).
//
// Two of them held the account credentials and the login gate's shared secret,
// and the third was their union with the shared type above — what the runtime
// really handed the entry point. They were declared outside the global block on
// purpose, so that code holding the shared type could not spell the names and a
// new reader would not compile (Phase 9 D-14). That worked, and then the reason
// for the names themselves went away: the credentials arrive per person in a
// grant's encrypted props, and the gate the shared secret guarded was replaced by
// the login page.
//
// THE UNION TYPE WAS DELETED RATHER THAN ALIASED to the shared type. The same
// argument the removed allow-list Secret above settles: a half-removed binding is
// a name the compiler still accepts and nobody reads. There is no longer an entry
// environment distinct from the shared one, and keeping the name would say there
// is — so the entry point, the OAuth provider's options, the door and the login
// handler all take the plain shared type now.
//
// The bindings are gone from the platform too, not merely from this file, and the
// scan refuses a read of either account name under this tree. That rule was a
// COUNT permitting exactly one reader until the reader was deleted; zero became
// the correct number, so it became a ban. This file is inside its scope, which is
// why the paragraph above describes the account bindings by role rather than
// spelling them.
