// The /authorize surface: a person signs in with their OWN Apple ID and app-
// specific password, and the credentials go into the grant's encrypted props.
//
// **Phase 11 replaced what this file asks for.** It used to ask for one shared
// secret and compare it against a Workers Secret (D-01), which is how a
// single-user server against one Apple ID identified its one user. The server
// now has N users, and identity moved out of the environment and into the
// grant. So the form asks for an Apple ID and an app-specific password, the
// address is checked against an allow list before anything else is spent on it,
// one IMAP login proves the pair, and `completeAuthorization` stores both in
// props that only this server can decrypt. `src/principal.ts` is where they
// come back out.
//
// **This file renders nothing.** Every byte the reader sees is built by
// `src/auth/login-page.ts`, which owns the approved design contract, the copy
// and the security headers; this file decides WHICH response happens and in
// what order, and calls into the page for the one that has a body worth
// designing. That split is a locked decision rather than a tidiness: this file
// was already 32 KB before the phase added a credential form and three limiter
// layers to it.
//
// The full OAuth 2.1 ceremony still happens around this — dynamic client
// registration, PKCE-protected code exchange, refresh rotation, revocation —
// all owned by the provider. Only the identity step is ours.
//
// **The submitted credentials are spent and nothing else**: never echoed, never
// reflected into the rendered page, never logged, never included in an error,
// and never put in any store but the grant's own props. No object holding the
// password is constructed here — `principalFromProps` builds the one principal
// and keeps the password in its own holder, and this file never asks for it
// back. The password reader is not imported here and must never be.
//
// The credentials are NOT, however, the only untrusted input in the flow. The
// redirect URI
// is attacker-chosen too — client registration is unauthenticated by spec —
// and it decides where the authorization code is delivered. That is why the
// page names the client and the destination before it asks for anything
// (CR-04). The consent screen is now the second of two controls in front of
// that URI, not the sole one: an origin allowlist refuses the class outright
// before the form is ever rendered. The screen still earns its place, because
// the allowlist's loopback entry is a CLASS rather than an exact value — an
// attacker can register a client whose callback is a loopback address on some
// port, and that passes the allowlist. The code would then be delivered to a
// listener on the owner's OWN machine, which is small residual risk but not
// zero, and the screen is what surfaces it: the owner sees a loopback address
// on the page when they expected the remote origin.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// An omission stood here until plan 11-05. Plan 11-05 NARROWED it; it did not
// close it, and this paragraph said "closed" until the phase review of
// 2026-09-21 found otherwise. It is kept rather than erased — the same
// treatment the redirect-origin paragraph below records, and for the same
// reason: a reader who finds the fix has to be able to find what it replaced.
//
// This file used to record that its failure counter was not atomic and was not
// being made atomic. `get` -> compare -> `put` is a read-modify-write over an
// eventually-consistent store, so concurrent attempts all read the same value
// and the cap does not engage under parallel load. The omission was accepted
// while the thing behind the form was a high-entropy shared secret compared in
// constant time, against which two hundred parallel guesses a round is nothing.
// That argument left with the secret. What sits behind the form now is a real
// Apple app-specific password, and the cost of a guess is no longer this
// server's alone: every attempt lands at Apple, whose own lockout threshold is
// unpublished and must be assumed small.
//
// **What narrowed it is not an atomic counter either.** A burst now meets a
// platform rate-limit binding first, and the store counter was kept only for
// the hour that binding's window cannot reach. Three layers stand in front of
// Apple: the connecting source, the target address in a minute, and the target
// address across an hour. Each is argued where it is wired below.
//
// **None of the three is exact, and this file used to say otherwise.** It
// called the binding atomic. Cloudflare does not promise that. Its rate-limit
// binding keeps a counter per Cloudflare location, and those counters are
// eventually consistent. Cloudflare says plainly it is not for exact
// accounting. So:
//
// - Requests that land on different locations are counted separately.
// - Requests fired in parallel can all pass one window before the count
//   catches up.
// - The store counter cannot catch the overflow. It reads its value before the
//   login runs, so a parallel burst all reads the same number.
//
// What that means in practice: against one address, the three-a-minute and
// five-in-any-sixty-minutes figures hold for a patient, serial guesser (the
// hourly one exactly; see layer 3). They do NOT hold
// for a parallel or many-location burst. How far over they go depends on how
// many locations the attacker can reach and how fast they fire, and nothing in
// this file can measure that. Apple's lockout threshold is unpublished. If it
// is hit, what breaks is the owner's own Mail on his own devices.
//
// That is recorded as an ACCEPTED COST on 2026-09-21, not as a solved problem.
// The only exact per-target count on this platform is a Durable Object per
// person. 11-CONTEXT.md compared that design and declined it for v2.0 on
// deploy risk, on the belief that the binding was exact. That belief was
// wrong. So the comparison should be reopened with the real guarantee in hand,
// not treated as settled.
//
// 11-CONTEXT.md records that Durable Object comparison in full, deliberately,
// so a later phase that wants one does not have to re-derive it.
//
// A second omission stood here until 2026-08-14, and it was closed rather than
// quietly erased: this file used to record that it carried no allowlist of
// permitted redirect origins. What blocked that allowlist was never its cost —
// it was one constant then and it is one constant now. It was that the
// legitimate origin set was genuinely unobserved, and narrowing against a
// guess locks the owner out of their own server, which is worse than the
// outcome being prevented. Enumerating the live registration store on
// 2026-08-14 produced the real values and cleared the blocker. The observed
// set, the reasoning behind the matching rule, and the recovery for a wrong
// value now all live at ALLOWED_REDIRECT_ORIGINS below.

 * form, no stripping and no inserting.
 *
 * **Why there is nothing to invert here any more.** The value used to be
 * reduced — separators dropped, ends trimmed — on the way to Apple, and the
 * direction of that reduction was gated on spike S5: a manual check of whether
 * iCloud accepts the dashless form, which no automated job in this repository
 * may run (D-09). S5 was NOT RUN. The owner declined it on 2026-09-20, after
 * finding that the planned procedure could not work: it said to re-enter the
 * password in Mail.app, and Mail.app signs in through the Mac's system iCloud
 * account and never sees an app-specific password at all.
 *
 * Rather than measure it, the transformation was removed. Apple publishes no
 * format for these values — its own support page covers creating, managing and
 * revoking them and says nothing about length, character set or grouping — so
 * a server that edits the value is guessing at a grammar on the person's
 * behalf. Passing it through is the honest position when the measurement is
 * absent: Apple decides, because Apple is the only party that knows.
 *
 * **How to get the measurement later**, if somebody is refused at sign-in and
 * suspects the dash form is why: sign in through the login page with the
 * dashless form. Nothing in this file has to change first, because both forms
 * now reach Apple as typed. It costs one real attempt at Apple and one tick of
 * that person's hourly counter, so do it once, deliberately. If it signs in,
 * call `mail_imap_diagnose` and `dav_diagnose` from that session to check the
 * IMAP and DAV halves; both act for the credentials stored in the grant.
 *
 * Do NOT measure it by changing the `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` secret. An earlier
 * version of this note said to. Since phase 11 nothing that serves a request
 * reads that secret — every tool, the two diagnose tools included, acts for
 * the grant's stored credentials — so a swap changes nothing, and the two
 * identical results would be misread as "both forms work".
 *
 * **What this function still does, and why it is not the same act.** It derives
 * its own MEASUREMENT form — trim the ends, drop the separators — purely to
 * count characters, and that derived string never leaves this function. That
 * containment is the one structural property worth protecting: no variable
 * anywhere in this handler holds a transformed password, so there is nothing
 * for a later session to pick up and send onward by accident. Stripping
 * separators to COUNT and stripping them before SENDING are different acts, and
 * they were separated on purpose. Do not fold them back together.
 *
 * The cost of passing through, accepted: a value carrying a stray leading or
 * trailing space measures fine and reaches Apple with the space still on it,
 * where it is refused. The page's help copy is what pays that down — it tells
 * the reader to paste the value exactly as Apple showed it, and it is the only
 * place they can learn that, because every credential failure answers with the
 * same silent string.
 *
 * **This check is LOOSE on purpose, and this is the rule a later session will
 * be most tempted to tighten.** The argument, written here because a planning
 * file is not where the tempted reader will be looking:
 *
 * - **Apple publishes no format.** Its own support page for app-specific
 *   passwords covers creating, managing and revoking them and says nothing
 *   about length, character set or grouping. The four-groups-of-four shape is
 *   training knowledge plus exactly one observed sample — the owner's own.
 * - **The question it answers is "is this clearly not an app-specific
 *   password", never "is this exactly the grammar I remember".** A strict rule
 *   that is wrong refuses a legitimate family member behind a failure message
 *   that deliberately will not say why, and they have no way to learn the
 *   reason.
 * - **The requirement is still satisfied.** A clearly-wrong value is refused
 *   before any socket opens, because this function does no I/O and sits above
 *   the one proof call site.
 * - **The cost accepted:** a typo inside the band costs one attempt at Apple
 *   and one tick of the per-target counter, instead of being caught locally.
 * - **Do not tighten this into the observed grammar to catch more typos.** That
 *   reverses a decision made on 2026-09-20 with the silent-failure cost in
 *   view. Refusing more is safe for a user id, where a refusal is a fresh start;
 *   it is not safe here, where a refusal is a person locked out of a page that
 *   will not tell them why.
 *
 * Exactly three classes are refused and there is no fourth: an empty value; a
 * value still carrying white space once the dashes are gone; and a length
 * outside the band the two constants above describe.
 *
 * **It does not duplicate `isUsablePassword`**, which lives in
 * `src/principal.ts` and refuses a whitespace-only value and any control
 * character. That one runs SECOND, inside the principal constructor, and it is
 * the deeper of the two: it guards every construction site, including the
 * props read at the door on a later request, where no form was ever submitted.
 * This one runs FIRST because it is the only one of the two that can refuse
 * before a principal is built at all — which is what makes "nothing was opened
 * to Apple" true of the shape refusal rather than merely likely.

 * callbacks retain their original origin policy. The consent screen also
 * reduces every redirect URI to its origin, deliberately: a long
 * attacker-chosen path would push the origin itself out of view on the screen
 * where the user is deciding. The consequence is that `https://claude.ai/anything`
 * registers successfully and displays on the consent screen identically to the
 * genuine callback. Harm still requires an open redirect or a code-logging
 * endpoint ON THAT ORIGIN, so this stays residual and is not a reason to start
 * matching paths. It is written down because a client record no longer expires,
 * so such a registration is permanent where it used to age out — and because a
 * later reader could otherwise conclude the origin gate bounds the destination
 * exactly. For Claude it bounds the ORIGIN exactly. ChatGPT callbacks instead
 * require exact URI membership through CHATGPT_REDIRECT_URIS.
 *
 * IT NEVER THROWS. `clientMetadata` is the RAW JSON body a stranger posted, and
 * a throw here becomes a 500 whose description is the error's own message —
 * text that stranger wrote, served back out. So the whole body sits in a

     *
     * One helper for every refusal on this path, because they are the SAME
     * answer. A stopwatch, a status code and a body must not sort the causes
     * apart, and the cheapest way to hold all three true is for there to be one
     * place the answer is written.
     *
     * **It no longer counts anything.** The counter it used to bump was keyed
     * by the connecting source and was bumped by every caller alike — which
     * meant a shape refusal, which never touches Apple, spent the same budget a
     * wrong password did. The counter is now keyed by the TARGET and is bumped
     * at exactly one call site: the one that has just found out Apple turned a
     * password down. The last column below is the whole of that rule.
     *
     * | Cause                               | Error class        | Renders     | Status | Bumps the per-target hourly counter |
     * |-------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
     * | Badly-shaped app password           | — (Apple untouched)| the string  | 401    | No                                  |
     * | Address not on the list             | — (Apple untouched)| the string  | 401    | No                                  |
     * | Address unparseable or empty        | —                  | the string  | 401    | No                                  |
     * | Per-target burst trip (layer 2)     | —                  | the string  | 401    | No                                  |
     * | Per-target hourly cap (layer 3)     | —                  | the string  | 401    | No                                  |
     * | Wrong password                      | `ImapAuthError`    | the string  | 401    | Yes                                 |
     * | Apple refusing on availability      | `ImapThrottleError`| the throttle| 401    | No                                  |
     * | Connect, TLS or read failure        | `ImapConnectError` | the throttle| 401    | No                                  |
     *
     * **Why the four "No" rows above the wrong-password row are not an
     * oversight.** The counter bounds what APPLE sees. A refusal that happened
     * before the proof ran cost Apple nothing, so counting it would spend a
     * real person's budget on something that never reached Apple — and since
     * layers 2 and 3 are keyed by target, the person whose budget was spent is
     * not the person who spent it. Counting a limiter trip would be worse
     * still: the cap would refill itself, and an address that tripped once
     * could never come back inside the window.
     *
     * A throttle and a connect failure are both excluded for the same reason
     * read the other way: Apple either declined to answer or was never reached,
     * so neither is a guess. That is the same rule the dead-password marker is
     * given in the next phase.
     *
     * **The last row is decided here, and research left it open.** The throttle
     * wording — Apple is not answering right now, wait a few minutes — is
     * LITERALLY TRUE of a connect failure. The single failure string tells the
     * reader to check the address and the password, which is false on that path
     * and sends a family member hunting for a typo that does not exist. It
     * leaks no more than the throttle message already does, because a connect
     * failure can only happen after the allow-list check has passed.
     *
     * The branch reads the error's TYPE and never a caught value's text. The
     * mail tree classifies from the parsed reply, response codes before prose
     * hints, and this handler consumes that classification rather than
     * repeating it.
     *
     * The source-connection refusal is NOT built here. It is keyed by the
     * connecting source rather than by the address being tried, so it carries
     * no information about who is on the list, and it is answered above — before
     * any credential check exists to leak anything.

    // THE ACCEPTED COST, AND WHOSE IT IS.
    //
    // This layer and the one below it count by TARGET rather than by attacker.
    // So a stranger who knows a listed address can spend that person's login
    // attempts: enough POSTs carrying somebody else's Apple ID and a wrong
    // password, and that person cannot sign in until the window rolls.
    //
    // That is accepted by the owner, on 2026-09-20, and the bound is what makes
    // it acceptable. It blocks NEW sign-ins only. An existing grant never
    // touches this path — it is served by the token endpoint and the API
    // handler, neither of which consults a limiter — so nobody already signed
    // in loses anything, and the person locked out is locked out for an hour
    // rather than indefinitely: layer 3 below refuses until the oldest of the
    // last five failures is sixty minutes old. The owner chose an hour's
    // lockout on 2026-09-21, after the hour-boundary fix had briefly stretched
    // it towards two. The owner's own escape from a counter they tripped
    // themselves is in the phase runbook.
    //
    // Re-keying by attacker instead would not bound Apple attempts at all,
    // which is the one thing these layers exist to do: a guesser spread thin
    // across addresses would be counted as a guesser and never as a threat to
    // any one account, while Apple would see every attempt.
    //
    // A SECOND ACCEPTED COST: THIS LAYER COUNTS SUCCESSES TOO. Recorded after
    // the phase review of 2026-09-21. The binding is asked before the login
    // runs, and it has no way to give a slot back, so a correct password spends
    // a slot exactly as a wrong one does. The client is known to submit a
    // successful form twice (see `revokeExistingGrants` below). So a person who
    // mistypes twice and then types the right password spends slots one to
    // three, and the client's repeat submission is refused. The browser shows
    // the LAST response, so they read "check the address and the password"
    // even though the first correct submission already signed them in. Trying
    // again after a minute works.
    //
    // Why it is left alone. Counting only failures is not possible with this
    // binding. Raising the limit to make room would loosen the only brake on a
    // parallel burst, which is already weaker than it looks (see the file
    // header). A confusing message once in a while is the cheaper of the two.
    //
    // THE LAYER THAT IS NOT HERE. A fourth layer was considered and declined
    // for this milestone: a ceiling on total sign-in attempts across every
    // listed address at once. Recorded as a decision rather than left as an
    // absence, because an absence reads as an oversight. The allow list holds
    // exactly one address for the whole of this milestone, so a ceiling across
    // several has nothing to bind that the per-target layer does not already
    // bind. Revisit when the list grows past one.
    // ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    //
    // A BINDING THAT THROWS IS A REFUSAL, and it takes the same exit as a trip.
    // This line runs only for a listed address. So a throw that escaped here
    // would come back as a fast 500 for listed addresses and never for unlisted
    // ones, which sorts the list by status and by stopwatch. Refusing through
    // the one helper keeps the body, the status and the floor the same. The
    // caught value is never read.

    // LAYER 3, the target address across an hour. At most five failed guesses
    // reach Apple in any rolling sixty minutes, and the next is refused.
    //
    // This is the layer the platform cannot supply: a rate-limit binding's
    // window accepts ten seconds or sixty and nothing longer, so an hour has to
    // be a record in a store. It is read AFTER the binding above, deliberately
    // — the binding costs no round trip and this does.
    //
    // A SLIDING LOG, NOT A COUNT. One key per person holds the times of their
    // last five failures, newest last. A failure counts while it is at most
    // sixty minutes old. Five that count means refuse. So, for a serial
    // guesser:
    //
    // - At most five failures reach Apple in any sixty minutes. There are no
    //   fixed hours, so there is no boundary to straddle.
    // - A lockout lasts until the oldest of the five is sixty minutes old, and
    //   the next attempt is allowed a millisecond later.
    // - A success writes nothing, and a refusal writes nothing.
    //
    // Why this and not a count per clock hour. The owner chose a lockout of
    // about an hour on 2026-09-21. The first design read two hourly buckets
    // and summed them, which held a lockout for up to two hours. The second
    // weighted the previous hour instead. That brought the lockout back to
    // about an hour but let a patient guesser place nine attempts at Apple in
    // forty-nine minutes, because a count with no times in it cannot tell a
    // burst at 10:59 from one at 10:00. It was replaced with this log the same
    // day. Keeping the times is what makes the bound exact.
    //
    // Non-atomic. It counts a patient attacker's serial attempts exactly. It
    // does not catch a parallel or many-location burst, because every request
    // in the burst reads the same list before any of them writes, and the store
    // is eventually consistent. Such a burst can go over five. That is the same
    // accepted cost as layer 2, and the file header records it.
    //
    // One read and, on a failure at Apple, one write. Never a combinator:
    // convention 3 forbids one anywhere in `src/auth/`.
    //
    // A STORE THAT THROWS IS A REFUSAL too, for the same reason as the binding
    // above: only a listed address gets here. An unreadable record reads as a
    // full one. So does one that is not a JSON list of finite numbers, and so

      // up. Then: 401, re-discovery, two more registrations, another
      // authorization, and round again.
      //
      // The library's own note on the default says it "prevents stale tokens
      // from causing infinite re-auth loops when props change". Here it CAUSED
      // that loop. The condition it guards against is a second sign-in carrying
      // DIFFERENT props; the condition it met was a second sign-in carrying
      // identical ones, which is not a stale token at all.
      //
      // What is given up, stated plainly because it is real: when someone
      // rotates their app-specific password and signs in again, the old grant
      // holding the dead password is no longer swept away in the same step. It
      // is not a hole — the dead password fails at Apple — but grants now
      // accumulate, and clearing them is phase 12's revoke script (LIFE-05).
      // LIFE-03 already promises one Apple ID may be signed in from several
      // Claude apps at once, so concurrent grants are the intended shape; this
      // makes that explicit rather than accidental.
      //
      // Do not restore the default to "tidy up" grant accumulation. That is
      // LIFE-05's job, and putting it back reinstates the lockout above.

    // THE AUTONOMY KEY (Phase 27, D-26). Autonomy is inherent, so this runs on
    // every sign-in, for every client, whenever autonomy is set up.
    //
    // WHY HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE (AUTO-01). This is the only place outside the
    // door that holds a principal Apple has just proved, and the only place a
    // person has just read the sign-in page. A Claude app refreshing its own
    // token never reaches this line, so nothing is minted without an
    // interactive sign-in.
    //
    // A second authorization, for the autonomy client, with the same user id
    // and the same props object as the ordinary one above. The ordinary grant,
    // its props, its metadata and the 302 below are not changed by it.
    //
    // `revokeExistingGrants: false` here too, for a reason of its own: the
    // library's sweep would revoke the autonomy grant a second sign-in is still
    // arming (the client submits this form twice). The object's arm is the only
    // sweep of autonomy grants (D-13, D-28).
    //
    // THE CODE NEVER REACHES THE BROWSER. It is read out of the library's
    // redirect URL here, in memory, and handed to the person's own object. The
    // redirect URI is never served and no browser is ever sent there (D-29).
    //
    // The whole call sits in a `try` whose `catch` reads nothing: a missing
    // client record, a store error, anything, means this sign-in arms nothing
    // and answers exactly as it would have.
    //
    // THE NOTICE FIELD (D-30). Arming also needs the hidden field the page
    // renders only when it shows the autonomy notice, carrying that notice's
    // version. Nobody is armed from a page that did not show the words, such as
    // one opened before autonomy was set up, and the field costs nothing to a
    // person who saw them.
