// Every byte a person sees at /authorize, and nothing else.
//
// This is the only user interface in the project, and since Phase 11 it asks a
// real person — a family member or a friend — for their own Apple ID and an
// app-specific password belonging to their own Apple account. Rendering lives
// here rather than in `src/auth/login-handler.ts` because that file is already
// 32 KB of flow control and this phase adds a credential form and three limiter
// layers to it. The split is a locked decision, not a tidiness.
//
// **The page this file renders is an APPROVED design contract**, signed off on
// seven dimensions and recorded in
// `.planning/phases/11-login-page-and-the-switch/11-UI-SPEC.md`. The copy, the
// ordering, the colour tokens, the type scale, the spacing scale and the
// accessibility rules below are implementations of that contract rather than
// choices made here. Changing one of them is a change to a decision.
//
// Five properties are worth knowing before reading the markup, because each one
// is load-bearing and none of them is obvious from the code alone.
//
// **No script, no image, no icon, no web font.** That is what lets the policy
// header stay as narrow as it is: `default-src 'none'` stands in front of
// everything, so the inline style is safe — CSS exfiltration needs an outbound
// request and no directive permits one. It also means there is no pending
// state, and that too is decided: the submit button is never disabled or
// relabelled while the check runs, and the mitigation is the button's help line
// plus the server-side limiters. Do not add a script to fix that.
//
// **No submitted value is ever rendered back.** Neither credential field
// carries a pre-filled-value attribute on any path, and no failure body has an
// interpolation slot. Both boxes come back empty after a failure, so re-typing
// is the only recovery, and the second line of the failure copy says so out
// loud rather than letting it read as a bug.
//
// **One failure string on the credential path.** A badly-shaped app password,
// an unlisted address, a malformed Apple ID, a wrong password and a per-target
// limiter trip all render the SAME body at the same 401. The owner decided that
// on 2026-09-20 with the cost in view: a family member who mistypes gets no
// signal telling a typo apart from a refusal. Do not split it to "improve the
// error" — that reverses the decision. The Apple-throttle message is the sole
// exception and it can only be built after Apple has already answered.
//
// **Which is why the password field's help copy is load-bearing.** With every
// credential failure answering the same silent string, that one line is the
// only place on the page a reader learns what to type. It used to name a shape
// — sixteen letters, an example with dashes, and a claim that the dashes were
// optional. That claim was only ever true if Apple said so, and Apple has never
// published a format for these values; the shape came from one observed sample.
// Spike S5, which would have measured it, was declined by the owner on
// 2026-09-20, and the handler stopped editing the submitted value in the same
// change. So the copy now tells the reader to paste the value exactly as Apple
// showed it, which is advice this project can actually stand behind.
//
// Keep it above the field, where it is read before typing rather than after
// submitting, and do not shorten it. If a future session reinstates a shape
// claim here, it owes the measurement first — `couldBeAppPassword` in
// `./login-handler` says how to take it.
//
// **The page must be recognisably NOT Apple's.** No Apple logo, no wordmark, no
// Apple system blue, no imitation of Apple's own sign-in page. A page that asks
// for an Apple credential while dressed as Apple teaches the reader that
// Apple-looking pages deserve Apple credentials, which is the habit every
// credential-phishing attack depends on. Trust comes from the copy saying
// plainly what this is, who is asking, and where it will send them.
//
// **This module holds no logging call and must never acquire one**
// (Convention 4). Nothing here reads a password, and nothing here can: the page
// is handed a query string and a client identity, and that is all.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// On the import cycle with `./login-handler`, which is deliberate and safe.
//
// This module imports the destination display helper, the origin derivation,
// the allowlist predicate and the two field names from the handler; the handler
// imports the renderer, the header constant, the per-destination header builder
// and the refusal bodies from here. That cycle exists ON PURPOSE. The allowlist
// check, the consent line and the `form-action` directive must read the SAME
// derived origin — a second derivation would let the page name one origin,
// permit another and check a third, which is a mitigation lying about what it
// mitigated — and the field names must be the same strings the form writes and
// the handler reads.
//
// It resolves because nothing crosses the cycle at module-evaluation time. Every
// binding imported here is used inside a function body — `renderForm`'s or
// `responseHeadersFor`'s — and every binding the handler imports from here is
// used inside a request. Neither module calls into the other while it is still
// initialising, so the load order does not matter. Keep it that way: a top-level
// call across this boundary would turn a working cycle into an undefined binding
// at cold start.
//
// `RESPONSE_HEADERS` is the one value here built by a call at module-evaluation
// time, and that is safe for exactly one reason: `contentSecurityPolicy` is
// declared in THIS file and calls nothing outside it. Do not reach across the
// cycle from that initialiser — building the constant from `originOf` or from
// the allowlist would be the cold-start failure this note is about.
//
// `RECALL_NOTICE` is the other value built at module-evaluation time. Its day
// count is computed from `RECALL_TTL_MS`, imported from `../recall/retention`.
// That module holds constants and imports nothing, so it is outside this cycle
// and adds nothing to it.

/**
 * The security headers every response this handler serves must carry.
 *
 * Exported for the reason `UNCONFIGURED_BODY` is exported: the table test then
 * asserts against the value the handler actually serves rather than a second
 * copy of four header values that could drift from it. This is the first shared
 * header constant in this project — every response built before this phase
 * spelled its headers inline, and two of them carried no caching header at all.
 *
 * What each one is for:
 *
 * `default-src 'none'` closes everything, including scripts, which is why the
 * no-script rule above is worth keeping. `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` is safe
 * precisely because that default stands in front of it: CSS-based exfiltration
 * needs an outbound request and no directive permits one. `frame-ancestors
 * 'none'` and the legacy framing header are the clickjacking pair, and they are
 * on EVERY response rather than only the form. `no-referrer` keeps the
 * authorization query out of an outbound request's referrer. `no-store` is the
 * one that matters most on the two redirects: the success redirect's location
 * header carries the authorization code, and a cached copy of that redirect is
 * a cached copy of a credential-equivalent.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `form-action` is the one that is NOT fixed, and this is why.
 *
 * This constant carries the bare `'self'` form. That is the right answer for
 * every response that has no destination — the 404, the 503, the 405, the
 * per-source 429, the unknown-client 400, and the refused-destination 403. It
 * was the WRONG answer for the sign-in page itself, and it broke the flow in a
 * way nobody could see.
 *
 * What `'self'` alone does is not only stop an injected form posting these two
 * fields elsewhere. It also decides where a form submission may END UP, and a
 * submission that ends up somewhere is a submission that followed a redirect.
 * Our own flow ends in one: the POST to `/authorize` answers 302 to the
 * client's callback, and that callback is `https://claude.ai/...`, which is not
 * `'self'`. WebKit still checks the redirect against the submitting document's
 * `form-action`, so Safari refused to follow our own 302. Chromium stopped
 * checking redirects against this directive, which is why the identical flow
 * works in Chrome.
 *
 * MEASURED IN SAFARI ON 2026-09-23, not theorised. `wrangler tail` showed
 * `POST /oauth/register 201` twice, `GET /authorize 200`, `POST /authorize 302`
 * — and then nothing at all. No `POST /oauth/token` ever arrived. The live
 * store held the resulting grants with no token record under them, so the code
 * was issued and never exchanged. Safari's own network panel showed no 302
 * being followed. What the person saw was Claude saying they started connecting
 * and did not finish. There is no error anywhere, because the browser refused
 * the navigation silently and this server's side of it succeeded.
 *
 * PHASE 11'S CODE REVIEW PREDICTED THIS AND IT WAS SKIPPED. Finding WR-05 said
 * `form-action 'self'` may block the success redirect. It was skipped on the
 * strength of one real sign-in whose logs showed the token exchange happening —
 * true, and taken in a Chromium browser, which is the one browser this directive
 * no longer breaks. The finding also named Chromium as the browser at risk,
 * which is backwards. Evidence from the browser that cannot reproduce a bug is
 * not evidence the bug is absent.
 *
 * So `responseHeadersFor` widens the directive by exactly one origin: the
 * destination this very request is about to be sent to. That is not a new
 * permission. `isAllowedRedirectUri(uri)` has already decided this
 * server will deliver an authorization code there, and the page has already
 * NAMED it to the reader in the consent block. Letting the form reach the one
 * origin the form is about is narrower than the reader has already been told.
 *
 * Nothing else widens. No wildcard, no scheme-only source, no second origin,
 * and no value that has not passed the allowlist — a refused destination never
 * renders a page at all, so there is no path on which an unvalidated origin
 * could reach the directive.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Spread this FIRST at every construction site and let the site's own headers
 * follow, so a site can never silently drop one of the four.

 * exists to leak anything. That is why it is the one refusal allowed a status
 * of its own.

 * **The design contract contradicted itself here, and this is where that was

 * about to be rewritten bought nothing. Plan 11-05 is that replacement, so the

 * counted and goes to Apple to make a new one. Naming the connection is the
 * correction.

 * location and its epochs are wall-clock aligned, so "sixty seconds from now"
 * is not a promise this server can keep; somebody who comes back too early

/**
 * The whole style block, as one string.
 *
 * Three type sizes (14, 16, 20) and two weights (400, 600). Every spacing value
 * is a multiple of four drawn from the declared scale, with no exceptions. Two
 * media queries and no others: one swaps the colour tokens for the dark scheme,
 * one adapts the card at phone width.
 *
 * Two properties are removed from what this page used to do, and both removals
 * are deliberate changes to working code:
 *
 * The full-viewport grid and its vertical centering are GONE. The page is now
 * taller than a phone viewport, and a centred item that overflows clips its own
 * top — which loses the heading, the client name and the destination first, in
 * that order. Top-aligned never clips.
 *
 * The translucency that used to dim body copy is GONE. It landed around 4.4:1
 * and shifted with whatever sat behind it; the muted token is a measured 7.2:1
 * in light and 7.0:1 in dark. Dimming text with translucency is banned on this
 * page, not merely avoided.
 *
 * The two inputs are 16px and that is not negotiable. iOS Safari zooms the page
 * whenever a focused input is below 16px, which throws the consent block off
 * screen at the exact moment the person is about to type a credential.
 *
 * The accent token is reserved for the submit button's background, the focus
 * ring and the two links. Nothing else is ever accent-coloured, because the
 * submit button is the page's single focal point and the only full-width block
 * of solid colour.
 *
 * The notice block above the fields follows the same rules: the existing border
 * and text tokens, spacing from the scale of four, 14px lines like the
 * explainer, no accent colour and no media query of its own. It is framed by a
 * border rather than coloured, so it reads as part of the page and not as the
 * page's focal point.

/**
 * The login page, for a first load or for either failed render.
 *
 * `query` is the raw authorization query, round-tripped through a hidden field
 * so the POST re-runs the provider's own client, redirect-URI, response-type
 * and PKCE validation against it. A tampered hidden field is then rejected by
 * the library rather than trusted by this server.
 *
 * Order on the page is fixed and is not a suggestion: heading, lead, the
 * consent block naming the client and then the destination origin, the
 * not-an-Apple-page line, the notice block, the error region when a previous
 * attempt failed, the form, then the four explainer sections. The consent block
 * stays ABOVE the credential fields — do not move it, collapse it, or put it
 * behind a disclosure. It is the control that lets a person tell an attacker's
 * client from their own before they type anything.
 *
 * `notices` is REQUIRED, not optional, so a call site that forgets it fails to
 * compile rather than silently hiding the notice. The notice block sits above
 * the fields for the same reason the consent block does: it is consent. It tells
 * a person what this server keeps before they type anything, and a notice read
 * after signing in is not consent. It shows on every render, first load and
 * failed attempt alike. An empty list renders nothing, not an empty box.
 *
 * **Neither credential input carries a pre-filled-value attribute on any path**,
 * and nothing the reader submitted reaches this function at all. The only
 * values interpolated are the round-tripped query, the client's registered name
 * and the destination origin.
 *
 * Accessibility, in the three places it is doing real work:
 *
 * Every input has a real label element and a help paragraph it points at
 * through its describedby attribute. When a previous attempt failed, the error
 * region's id is added to BOTH inputs' describedby, so the reason is announced
 * when focus lands on the field rather than only when the region is passed.
 *
 * After a credential failure the invalid marker goes on BOTH inputs,
 * unconditionally, and is never narrowed to one even when the server knows
 * which check failed. Putting it on the password alone would rebuild the
 * shape-specific signal the owner removed, in the accessibility tree. After the
 * Apple-throttle failure it goes on neither, because nothing the reader typed
 * was rejected.
 *
 * The document title changes on a failed render, and that change is the only
 * signal a screen-reader user gets that the page came back different. It is
 * cheap and it is the whole no-script accessibility budget.
 *
 * Every failed render is 401, the throttle case included. One status for both
 * removes any need to prove a second one does not leak.
 *
 * The Apple ID field is `type="text"`, NOT `type="email"`, and it is deliberate.
 * A browser refuses to submit a form whose `email` field it does not like, and
 * does it silently as far as the reader is concerned — the tooltip is easy to
 * miss, and nothing reaches the server, so there is no error body, no status and
 * no log line. The symptom would be a Sign in button that does nothing at all.
 *
 * Provenance, stated because the first version of this note got it wrong: this
 * was written while chasing a reported "Sign in does nothing" on 2026-09-21, and
 * claimed to have fixed it. It did not. The Worker logs showed the whole flow
 * succeeding twice over, with no 4xx anywhere; the real problem was a client
 * holding a stale connection. Nothing here was ever broken. So this is a
 * hardening, and the failure above is one it forecloses rather than one it fixed.
 *
 * Keeping it is still right, because it is the same mistake this phase already
 * declined to make about the password. Apple publishes no app-specific password
 * format, so the shape check refuses only what cannot be one under any grammar;
 * an Apple ID is a format this project controls just as little. Letting the
 * BROWSER enforce a rule nobody here wrote, over a value Apple defines, is that
 * rule arriving by the back door.
 *
 * `inputmode="email"` stays, so a phone still offers the @ key. `required`
 * stays, because an empty box is refusable without claiming to know the format.
 * The real gate is the server, which refuses before opening any socket to
 * Apple. Do not put `type="email"` back.
