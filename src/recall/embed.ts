// The embedder for semantic recall (Phase 25, D-02, D-05).
//
// Turns text into the vectors the recall index holds. This is the ONLY module
// under `src/` that reads the AI binding off the environment, and it holds the
// one model id. A scan count in plan 25-04 holds the one reader, and zero
// readers is a violation too.
//
// Two ways in. `createEmbedder(ai)` takes the binding as a parameter, so tests
// pass a fake. `embedder()` reads the real binding, for production. Nothing
// assigns onto the environment.
//
// One call per batch, with the texts as an array. The answer is refused, and
// nothing downstream runs, unless it holds exactly one vector per text, each of
// exactly RECALL_DIMENSIONS finite numbers. The index's dimension is fixed when
// it is created, so a vector of any other length would be refused by the store
// anyway; refusing it here means nothing is written first.
//
// A failed call becomes `RecallEmbedError`. The caught value is never read: its
// text is the platform's, and nothing about it belongs in an answer. This
// module logs nothing (./.claude/CLAUDE.md §4).
