// The recall store (Phase 25, RCLL-01, D-02, D-03).
//
// The ONLY module under `src/` that may name the vector index binding. A scan
// count in plan 25-04 holds that, and zero is a violation too: a store whose
// one reader was moved or emptied guards nothing, and that loss is quieter than
// a duplicate.
//
// WHY THE STORE IS WRAPPED AT ALL. It fails open. A query that names no
// partition is read as searching every person's vectors (SPIKE-09 (4) is
// unstated, so this designs to the cautious reading). Nothing refuses such a
// query; it simply answers with other people's mail. So the partition and the
// filter are set here, from the signed-in principal, and nowhere else. Every
// read and write method takes a `Principal`. None takes a partition name, a
// user id string, or the environment.
//
// THREE LAYERS, each with its own test that goes red when it is removed
// (test/recall-isolation.test.ts):
//
//   1. The partition. Every query and every write names the principal's user id
//      as its partition, set LAST in the options so no caller field can
//      replace it.
//   2. The metadata filter. Every query filters on `u` equal to the user id,
//      and every write stores `u`. The store needs a string metadata index on
//      `u` for this. Without that index the filter matches nothing, so this
//      layer fails closed.
//   3. The returned-match check. Every match whose stored `u` is not the
//      caller's user id is dropped before anything leaves this module.
//
// Three of the binding's verbs are never used here, and plan 25-04 bans them.
// They are described by role, because the scan reads comments too:
//
//   - the by-id read verb and the by-id query verb both skip the partition, so
//     either one could reach another person's vector by id;
//   - the keep-first write verb keeps whatever is already stored under an id,
//     so a re-index would silently change nothing, forever.
//
// Every write goes through the upsert verb, which replaces what an id held.
//
// Deletes take ledger ids only. The ids come from the person's own ledger in
// their own object (src/agent/recall-ledger.ts), which only ever holds ids
// this module computed for that person.
//
// A rejection from the binding becomes `RecallStoreError`, and the caught value
// is never read. This module logs nothing (./.claude/CLAUDE.md §4).
