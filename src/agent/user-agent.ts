// The per-person Durable Object (Phase 24, D-01, D-03, D-05).
//
// One object per signed-in person. Phase 24 gave it ONE thing: a connection
// lease record, at storage key `lease`, of the shape `{ token, expiresAt }`.
// Phase 24 also said it holds no user id. That is no longer true, and is
// corrected here rather than left false: see the recall paragraph below. It
// still holds no address and no credential.
//
// It is a lease holder and never a session holder. It never opens a socket, and
// it never imports mail, DAV or tool code. The reason is cost and time, not
// tidiness. An open socket keeps a Durable Object resident and billed for up to
// 15 minutes per connection. And a socket held here would escape the 20-second
// call deadline that bounds every mail conversation in the Worker request
// (ARCHITECTURE §3.2). So the socket stays in the Worker request, and this
// object only records "this person has one conversation open until time T".
//
// Only one place builds a stub for it: `agentFor` in `./lease.ts`, from the
// signed-in principal's user id, through the namespace's by-name accessor. The
// namespace offers three other id helpers — the name-to-id helper, the
// string-to-id helper and the random-id helper. None of them is used under
// `src/`, and they are described here by role only because the scan reads
// comments too.
//
// Since Phase 25 it also holds the person's recall ledger: two SQLite tables
// listing every vector id they own in the recall index, with no text, no ref
// and no address (./recall-ledger.ts says why the ledger is mandatory). And it
// holds a copy of its own name, under `own-name` beside the lease, which is the
// person's user id as the platform gave it to `agentFor`. The alarm needs to
// know whose grants to ask about, and the platform's name is not documented as
// present inside an alarm.
//
// Since Phase 27 it also holds, because autonomy is inherent, one sealed
// autonomy record for every person who has signed in since autonomy was set up
// and is still connected: the refresh token of their autonomy grant, sealed
// under a Worker secret and tied to their user id (./autonomy.ts says how). So
// what the object holds is: a lease record, its own stored name, Phase 25's
// recall tables (Phase 26 keeps its folder state there too), its one alarm, and
// that one sealed record. Still no address and no password.
//
// Since Phase 28 it also holds the person's autonomy rules, what the rules job
// did (a ring of the last 100 entries, with no subject, address or text), the
// job's own state (the stored change marker, the next wake, the last run), and
// one "already acted" record per rule, action and message. No grant id is
// stored for the job, and nothing in it reads the autonomy record's fields.
//
// It still never opens a socket and never imports mail, DAV, tool or auth code.
// It reaches this Worker only through `autonomySelfFetch`, its one seam to the
// Worker's own endpoints. The rules job reaches mail that way too: each call it
// makes is a tool call at this Worker's own `/mcp`, where the door takes the
// person's connection lease like any other request.
//
// Recall is inherent (owner, 2026-09-27), so there is no switch here: no method
// that turns recall on or off, and no enabled flag. The first record for a
// person needs no earlier call.
//
// ONE ALARM SLOT, SHARED. An object has one alarm, and recall was its first
// user. Its jobs today, in the order `alarm()` runs them: autonomy first (Phase
// 27: does the key still stand?), then the rules job (Phase 28), then recall's
// revocation (a pending destroy, or no grant left), then recall's expiry. All
// of them keep the alarm through `anyJobPending()`. Every set and every removal
// goes through one helper, `scheduleAlarm`, which removes the alarm only when
// `anyJobPending()` says no job is left and otherwise never moves a set alarm
// later. A second call that sets the alarm, or a second condition for removing
// it, would silently drop another job's schedule.
//
// This module logs nothing (./.claude/CLAUDE.md §4).

   * Arm the autonomy key from a one-time code (Phase 27, D-09, D-16, D-26).
   *
   * The one RPC method autonomy adds. The sign-in calls it after its answer has
   * gone, through the request's `waitUntil`, with the code of the autonomy grant
   * it just minted. Answers `{ kind: "armed", grantId }` or
   * `{ kind: "not_armed" }`, and nothing else: no token and no bearer ever
   * crosses back out.
   *
   * The name comes from Phase 25's `rememberOwnName()`, called FIRST (25 D-22).
   * An autonomy record can exist before this object ever had a recall call, so
   * arming must store the name itself: the alarm (plan 27-05) reads the stored
   * copy to know whose grants to ask about, and a record in an object with no
   * stored name could never be ended by it. With no name, nothing is armed.
   * This method never reads the platform's name itself; the one reader of it in
   * this module stays inside `rememberOwnName`.
   *
   * The whole arm runs inside `autonomyQueue.run`, after the name is known, so
   * two sign-ins arming at once run one after the other (D-27). While it
   * waits, its grant id is listed in `pendingArmGrants`, so an arm ahead of it
   * does not sweep the grant it is about to arm.
   *
   * Never throws: an error's class does not survive RPC, and the caller must be
   * able to tell "not armed" from nothing at all.
