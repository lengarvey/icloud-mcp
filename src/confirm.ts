// The confirmation capability, and its protocol-neutral refusal.
//
// A signed, single-use, short-lived authorisation to apply ONE reviewed change
// to ONE named resource. Nothing here knows what a calendar is, what a mailbox
// is, or how a change is eventually written; it mints a payload, seals it,
// reads it back, hashes a change canonically, and reserves a one-time slot.
// The payload has an arm per kind of target and that sentence is still true:
// an arm is a FIELD SHAPE, not protocol knowledge. This module issues no
// request, reads no resource, and never inspects a value it seals.
//
// **The first clause of that paragraph has been NARROWED, and the narrowing is
// written here rather than left for a reader to notice.** This module now knows
// a closed list of eight resource WORDS — see `ConfirmationNoun` — because
// CONF-04 puts the human-facing sentence in one place and a sentence has to
// name its subject. So "nothing here knows what a calendar is" is no longer
// literally true: this module knows that "calendar" is one of the words it may
// print. What is still true is the part that was ever load-bearing. It issues
// no request, reads no resource, resolves no identifier, and holds no opinion
// about what a calendar CONTAINS or how one is addressed; the nouns are a
// vocabulary for a sentence, not protocol knowledge, and a caller cannot widen
// them, which is what keeps a caller-chosen word out of the line. A bound that
// is quietly false is worse than a narrower one that is true.
//
// **Why the source root rather than inside a protocol tree.** `V2-MAIL-02`
// ("mail delete and move behind the same preview-then-commit safety") is
// already on the books, so the NEXT consumer of this module is a mail delete,
// not a calendar write. A confirmation module living in `src/dav/` would later
// have to be either imported across ARCHITECTURE Q1's zero-import boundary or
// copied — and `src/tokens.ts` names the copy as the failure in its own header:
// *a rule living in two decoders is a rule that drifts.* The rule that would
// drift here is the six-causes-one-answer refusal below, which is a paragraph
// of reasoning attached to a five-line function, and a copy without the
// paragraph is a copy someone makes helpful.
//
// **The obligation that placement creates.** This module raises a NEUTRAL
// error, and every protocol tree that verifies a confirmation owes it a
// translation at that tree's own boundary. See `ConfirmationInvalidError`.
//
// **The single-use guarantee is bounded, and this is where that is said.**
// Cloudflare KV is eventually consistent: a read at one edge location is not
// guaranteed to see a write made at another for a short propagation window, so
// two commits carrying the same confirmation, racing inside that window, can
// BOTH find the slot free and both pass. That is not a hedge against a
// hypothetical — it is how KV works, and claiming otherwise would leave a
// reader over-trusting this layer. Three things bound it:
//
//   - the token's own lifetime is minutes, so the window is a small fraction
//     of the period in which a replay is even possible;
//   - a confirmation is bound to ONE user — `ConfirmPayload.u` — and the
//     reserved slot is keyed under that same user, so the two commits racing
//     for one slot have to be signed in as the SAME person on two clients at
//     once. This bullet used to say something stronger and simpler: that this
//     is a single-user server, so two racing clients do not exist at all. That
//     stopped being true the moment the payload gained a user field, and a
//     bound that is quietly false is worse than a narrower one that is true;
//     and
//   - `If-Match` at the DAV server is an entirely independent second layer.
//     The loser of the race carries an etag the winner's write already
//     invalidated, and no amount of KV staleness turns that into a success.
//
//   - that second layer is a property of ONE protocol, and the mail arm does
//     not have it. IMAP has no `If-Match`. Its analogue is `UNCHANGEDSINCE`,
//     from the `CONDSTORE` extension, checked against the MODSEQ this module
//     sealed at preview — and it is NARROWER in two ways worth stating rather
//     than discovering. It rides on the command that changes a message's
//     flags, so it guards the flag change only: neither the command that
//     copies a message nor the one that removes it is covered, and the
//     verify-after step is still owed. And the command carrying it is not
//     written in this phase, which means today the mail arm has the one-time
//     KV slot and nothing else. The bullet above is not withdrawn — it is true
//     of the DAV arms — but a bound that is quietly false is worse than a
//     narrower one that is true, so the narrower one is what is claimed here.
//
// Neither layer is sufficient alone. This one refuses BEFORE any request is
// issued, which is what the requirement asks for; `If-Match` refuses at the
// server, which is what actually holds under a race.
//
// **Option B, which was NOT chosen, and is worth knowing about.** No KV at all
// — rely on `If-Match` plus the short lifetime, so a replayed update fails its
// precondition and a replayed delete finds nothing. That is genuinely
// defensible on the mechanics, and it is what keeps working if KV is ever
// unavailable. It was rejected for one reason only: the requirement says an
// already-used confirmation is rejected *before any DAV request is issued*, and
// `If-Match` cannot satisfy that, because it IS the DAV request.
//
// This module contains no logging calls of any kind and must never acquire any.
// ./.claude/CLAUDE.md §4 is not "no logging of credentials" — it is no logging
// at all under `src/` — and this is exactly the module where a "log the payload
// I am about to sign" line is tempting.

 * The refusal, named without naming a protocol — and without naming a cause.
 *
 * Built on `TokenDecodeError`'s shape: a fixed internal label, a `readonly
 * kind` discriminant, a `name` assignment, and no constructor argument at all.
 * The absent argument is the point rather than an omission — there is nowhere
 * for a cause, a field name or a quoted token to ride, even by accident.
 *
 * **What each protocol tree owes this class: a translation at its own
 * boundary.** This error is an internal signal, not a caller-visible outcome.
 * Every tree that verifies a confirmation must catch it and rethrow its own
 * class, because the shared error-categorisation function dispatches on TYPE
 * and falls through to a connection diagnosis for anything it does not
 * recognise — so a `ConfirmationInvalidError` that escaped would tell a caller
 * the network failed when what actually happened is that a confirmation was
 * refused. That is not merely imprecise: it points at the wrong remedy, telling
 * a model to retry the thing that will be refused identically.
 *
 * The DAV tree's translation is `DavConfirmationError` in `src/dav/errors.ts`,
 * which `davToErrorCategory` maps to `confirmation_invalid`. The join is
 * asserted end to end — and mutation-tested rather than assumed — in the final
 * describe block of `test/confirm.test.ts`.
 *
 * **Every cause answers identically, and that is a security property rather
 * than tidiness.** An unusable signing key, a token that is not two encoded
 * parts, a seal that does not verify, a payload that is not JSON, a payload
 * whose shape this build will not read, a version this build does not know, a
 * confirmation minted for another user, a target this caller did not expect, a
 * lifetime that has run out, a change that does not match what was confirmed,
 * and one already spent — all of them raise this, with the same label and the
 * same shape. A distinguishable refusal is an oracle for the confirmation's
 * internal structure, and the commonest way to reach one is a model probing the
 * format.
 *
 * That list is deliberately written out and deliberately carries no count. It
 * was short by two for a phase — the wrong user and the wrong target, each
 * added by the phase that added the check — and a count beside it would have
 * been a second thing to go stale rather than a guard against the first. The
 * enumeration that is actually asserted lives in
 * `test/confirm.test.ts`'s `EXPECTED_CAUSE_LABELS`, which fails when a produced
 * cause and a named one stop matching. Read this as the argument and read that
 * as the inventory.

/**
 * The payload format version.
 *
 * Bumping this is a DECISION rather than a refactor, on `DAV_TOKEN_VERSION`'s
 * reasoning with one difference in the blast radius. An identifier that has
 * left the building is in a transcript forever; a confirmation is dead in
 * minutes, so a format change invalidates only what is in flight at the moment
 * it lands. That makes this the cheap version field rather than the expensive
 * one — but it earns its bytes for the same reason: a future format change
 * becomes DETECTABLE, refused outright, rather than silently misread as the
 * current shape and applied to the wrong resource.
 *
 * **Bumped to 2 when the payload gained `u`, and the cost is named rather than
 * discovered.** Every preview in flight at that deploy dies: its token carries
 * `v: 1`, the check below is a strict inequality against this constant, and a
 * version this build does not know is refused outright. That is the correct
 * behaviour rather than a fault — a v1 token has no `u` at all, and admitting
 * one would be admitting a confirmation nobody can say belongs to anyone. The
 * owner accepted this cost by name (D-12); it costs each affected preview one
 * re-preview and nothing else.
 *
 * **Bumped to 3 when the payload gained `t`, and the cost is the same cost,
 * named again rather than assumed to have been paid once.** Every preview in
 * flight at THAT deploy dies too: its token carries `v: 2`, the check below is
 * the same strict inequality, and a version this build does not know is refused
 * outright. That is the correct behaviour rather than a fault — a v2 token says
 * nothing about which KIND of resource it names, and admitting one would be
 * admitting a confirmation whose fields a commit would read under whatever
 * field names that commit happened to expect. The owner priced this in D-12 and
 * in ARCHITECTURE §7; it costs one re-preview per confirmation alive at the
 * deploy, and the window in which any are alive is `CONFIRM_TTL_SECONDS` wide.
 *
 * No compatibility arm admits a v2 token back. An arm that read the old shape
 * and filled in a discriminator would be guessing at the one field the guess
 * was added to remove.
 *
 * **Bumped to 4 when the object arm gained `f`, and this is the bump where the
 * reasoning is worth reading rather than assumed from the two above it.** The
 * structural predicate REQUIRES `f` on that arm, so a v3 token is already
 * refused by `hasDavObjectArm` whether or not this constant moves — which makes
 * the bump look redundant. It is not, for two reasons.
 *
 * The first is that the predicate answers "is this shape readable" and the
 * version answers "is this shape MINE". A v3 token is a well-formed payload from
 * a build with different SEMANTICS: under v3 a calendar update's
 * `changedFields` meant the fields the change ASSERTED a value for, and under v4
 * it means the fields the preview OBSERVED moving. Those are different answers to
 * the question a user reads, and on a scopeless update they differed by seven —
 * eight reported where one moved, measured live on 2026-09-25. A token minted by
 * a build that meant the first thing, redeemed by a build that publishes the
 * second, is a confirmation whose two ends disagree about what the response says.
 * The version is the field that can state that; a field list cannot.
 *
 * The second is that the predicate's refusal is a coincidence of which fields it
 * happens to check, and a later edit that made `f` optional or defaulted it to
 * `[]` would admit a v3 token and publish "changing 0 fields" on a write that
 * changed one. That is the class of failure `t`'s own docstring describes, and
 * the version check is the layer that stays true through that edit.
 *
 * The cost is the same cost, named a third time rather than assumed to have been
 * paid twice: every preview in flight at the deploy dies, its token carries
 * `v: 3`, the check below is the same strict inequality, and it costs one
 * re-preview per confirmation alive at the deploy. The window in which any are
 * alive is `CONFIRM_TTL_SECONDS` wide.

 *
 * **`reply` is its own kind rather than a flavour of `update` (D-05).** An
 * answer to an invitation writes the user's own PARTSTAT and nothing else, and
 * an update token must never be spendable as one, nor the reverse. A separate
 * kind is what makes both directions a refusal: every commit arm checks the
 * signed kind against the set it has code for, and the reply's change hashes in
 * its own domain (`replyChangeHashOf`), so no update's hash can ever equal one.
 *
 * **Adding it did NOT bump `CONFIRM_VERSION`, and that is deliberate.** A new
 * kind changes the meaning of no field in any v4 token already in flight: every
 * existing token still names create, update or delete, and still means exactly
 * what it meant. The other direction is covered by the predicate rather than by

 * still names one of the four kinds above, and a build that predates `move`
 * refuses one through its own `hasConfirmPayloadBase`. So no version bump.

 * authorises adding one autonomy rule to the person's own object, and it is the
 * only kind the rule arm (`t: "rule"`) carries. No field of any token already in

 * being a meaningful first layer.
 *
 * **Against a longer value.** This is a signed capability to write to the

 * silently misread as the current one. The stored value carries nothing — the
 * KEY is the fact — so there is no payload to leak and no shape to misparse.
 *
 * `v2` because the user id now sits between this prefix and the jti, and that
 * id is a SECOND LAYER rather than tidiness.
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment said the opposite — that the jti is a UUID
 * and could not have collided across users anyway, so the id here was
 * housekeeping and the real fix was the check inside `verifyConfirmation`.
 * Measurement retracted that (D-12, corrected by plan 10-04). Mutating the user
 * check out of `verifyConfirmation` did NOT redden the slot-leak test, because
 * the scoped key closes the slot half of audit row T1 on its own: a caller who
 * reaches the reservation holding somebody else's confirmation burns a slot
 * under their OWN id, and the owner's confirmation still spends. Reddening that
 * test took a PAIR of mutations — the check moved after the reservation AND
 * this key flattened back. Two independent layers, not one layer and a tidy-up.
 *
 * So flattening this key would reopen half of T1. Two things refuse that today
 * and both are worth knowing, because neither is obvious from here: the key
 * shape is pinned byte-for-byte in `test/key-shapes.test.ts`, and a key
 * expression that does not put a user id straight after a prefix constant is
 * what the `store-key-without-a-user` scan rule exists to reject — the flat
 * form is that rule's own known-violating sample. What is NOT held is the
 * reasoning: a reader who decides from this paragraph that the id is optional
 * can change both of those to match. That is why the measurement is written
 * down here rather than only in the phase record.
 *
 * `v3` because the payload above it now names its own target, and the two
 * version segments are kept in step deliberately: a stored record and the token
 * it was written for belong to the same format, and a namespace that lagged
 * behind the payload would let a v3 token find a v2 slot already spent by a
 * token of a different shape. The user id still sits immediately after this
 * prefix and that has not moved — the bump changes the namespace and nothing
 * about the key's structure.
 *
 * `v4` because the object arm gained `f` and the in-step rule is a rule rather
 * than a case-by-case judgement. On this bump the rule's own reason does not
 * bite — a v3 token is refused at the version check, which runs before any
 * reservation, so it can never reach a slot to share one. What would bite is
 * leaving the rule's sentence in place while the two numbers diverged: a claim
 * that is quietly false is worse than a narrower one that is true, and this
 * project has that failure recorded in three other docstrings. Nothing is lost
 * by moving it. Every record under the old namespace belongs to a token that

   * diff between the change the caller asked for and the resource as it stood —
   * and it is not something a caller could sensibly re-supply, because
   * re-supplying it is re-supplying this server's own observation.
   *
   * **Why it has to travel at all, measured rather than reasoned.** On
   * 2026-09-25 a title-only update of a real event previewed correctly —
   * `changedFields: ["summary"]`, *"changing 1 field"* — and committed
   * *"changing 8 fields"*, listing every field of the change. A read-back proved
   * only the title had moved. The cause is that an update with no scope fills
   * every unmentioned field from the stored resource, which is what lets the
   * patch assert them, so at commit time every field of the change holds a value
   * and "what the change carries" is the whole of it. The commit had no channel
   * to the before-state as the preview saw it, so it published the only number it
   * had and published it under a name that means the other thing. Over-reporting
   * in the ALARMING direction, on the one response whose sentence also says the
   * previous values cannot be recovered.
   *
   * **A COMMIT COULD RE-DERIVE THIS, and it is sealed anyway.** Since plan 17-07
   * every update patches, and a patch re-reads the resource before it writes, so
   * the before-state is genuinely in the commit's hands and the diff is genuinely
   * computable there. Two things decide it the other way. The list answers *"what
   * did the person agree to"*, and the confirmation is this project's one channel
   * for that question — a re-derivation answers it only as long as the ETag
   * comparison inside the writer keeps holding, which makes the honesty of a
   * published sentence depend on a `!==` in another function. And a number this
   * server publishes as its own observation must not come off a request, which is
   * the rule `g` states and `ConfirmationSummary` states for every count in the
   * composed line.
   *
   * **What is NOT claimed: this is not an observation of the WRITTEN bytes.** It
   * is the diff as of the read the user was shown, which is the question
   * `changedFields` asks on both legs. Nothing here reads the resource back
   * afterwards, and the fields a commit reports are therefore what it set out to
   * move rather than what a fresh look confirmed had moved.
   *
   * **The VOCABULARY is closed, and the closure is held at the mint site rather
   * than here.** This module is protocol-neutral and has no business knowing
   * what a calendar field is called, so the type is `string[]`. Every value that
   * reaches it comes from `CHANGE_FIELDS` in `src/mcp/tools/calendar.ts` — or
   * from that file's own `"alarms"` literal, or from `ContactChangeField` on the
   * contacts path — and never from a string read off a resource
   * (./.claude/CLAUDE.md § 4). A preview that put stranger-authored text here
   * would publish it from inside the trusted half of the commit's response.
   *
   * REQUIRED and never optional, on `g`'s argument: an absent list does not read
   * as "nothing moved", it reaches the published array and the sentence's count
   * as a value nobody observed. An empty list is a real answer — the update that
   * moves nothing — and is not a missing one.
   *
   * **Sealed by every kind on this arm; read by the CALENDAR arms only.** A
   * calendar create and delete fill it and read it back, so all three kinds take
   * their published list from one place and no future kind can reintroduce the
   * disagreement. Both CONTACT legs fill it and neither reads it, on `s`'s
   * precedent exactly — their list is a pure function of the hash-bound change,
   * so preview and commit call one function over one bound value and cannot
   * disagree. The fact is true of the preview either way and it costs a value
   * already in hand.

   * observed, and its docstring reserves `null` for a create precisely so that
   * "unbound" is a state a type can forbid on an update and a delete.
   *
   * The silent failure that forbids: a collection has no entity tag, so the
   * path of least resistance is to pass `null` in `e` and move on. That turns
   * the one value reserved for creates into a value that ALSO means "we could
   * not bind this", and once one field carries both meanings the type can no
   * longer forbid an unbound delete. The most destructive operation in the
   * milestone loses its binding and nothing fails — no error, no warning, and a
   * delete that looks exactly like the one the user approved.
   *
   * REQUIRED, `string`, never `string | null` and never optional, on its own
   * arm. That is what makes unbound unreachable rather than discouraged: there
   * is no value a caller can put here that means "no binding", and no arm of
   * this union that omits the field.
   *
   * **This arm carries NO `e`, NO `r` and NO `s`, and each is absent rather
   * than null for its own reason.** A collection is not a resource with an
   * entity tag, so `e` has nothing to hold. A collection does not recur, so
   * there is no occurrence for `r` to name. A collection is not an iCalendar
   * object, so it carries no `SEQUENCE` for `s` to record. A null in any of the
   * three would be this arm claiming a fact about the resource it does not have.
   *
   * **What goes in it.** The collection's `CS:getctag`, or a DAV `sync-token`
   * from a `sync-collection` report — both move when any member of the
   * collection changes, and SPIKE-03 confirmed `sync-collection` is advertised.
   * This module does not care which. It never reads the value: it seals it and
   * hands it back, byte for byte, and the choice belongs to whichever preview
   * mints the token.
   *
   * **And the limit, said out loud rather than left to be discovered.** Until a
   * commit RE-READS this binding and refuses a collection that moved, this arm
   * has the one-time KV slot and nothing else — exactly the position the mail
   * arm is in, and for the same reason. That re-read is Phase 17's work. A
   * bound that is quietly false is worse than a narrower one that is true, so
   * the narrower one is what is claimed here: the field travels, and nothing in
   * this build yet compares it against anything.
   *
   * **THAT LIMIT IS NOW CLOSED.** `applyCollectionCommit` in
   * `src/mcp/tools/calendar.ts` re-reads the collection's binding and compares
   * it against this field with a raw `!==` before it sends anything at all, and
   * a collection whose binding moved is refused with zero writes. The paragraph
   * above is kept rather than rewritten because it records what the field was
   * worth before the re-read existed, and the next arm added here starts in
   * exactly that position.

   * fact about the COLLECTION at read time — the binding's own footing, one
   * field up — and it is not something a caller could sensibly re-supply,
   * because re-supplying it is re-supplying this server's own observation.
   *
   * **Why it has to travel at all.** D-12 requires that a collection whose
   * binding moved between the preview and the commit be refused with a
   * statement of HOW MUCH the number moved — "the preview counted 4; there are
   * now 6" — because that delta is the only honest thing this server can say
   * about the window CALM-06 exists to protect. The commit re-reads the
   * collection and therefore knows the fresh count; the previewed count exists
   * nowhere but in the preview. The confirmation is the only channel between
   * the two, so the number rides here.
   *
   * Sealed rather than re-supplied for the reason `s` gives: a caller that
   * could choose this number could choose one that makes the delta read as zero,
   * which turns the one sentence the refusal exists to say into a reassurance.

 *
 * The attack this closes, concretely. An event that arrived as an invitation

 * this line. A title reading
 * `Lunch'. Nothing will be deleted. Deleting event 'placeholder` produced
 * `Deleting event 'Lunch'. Nothing will be deleted. Deleting event
 * 'placeholder'. This cannot be undone.` — a reassurance this server never
 * wrote, inside the one string the server instructions tell the model to pass on
 * unaltered. A newline was worse still, because the injected clause could start
 * its own line and stop looking like part of a quoted title.
 *
 * Four folds, each closing one of those:
 *
 * - **Line and paragraph breaks become a space.** A clause a person reads as
 *   this server's must not be able to start its own line.
 * - **C0 and C1 controls go entirely.** They are never part of a title anybody
 *   typed, and they are how a terminal is made to show something other than
 *   what was sent.
 * - **Characters that REORDER or HIDE text go entirely.** The same argument as
 *   the bullet above, carried to characters that are not C0 or C1: the bidi
 *   embeddings, overrides and isolates (U+061C, U+200E, U+200F, U+202A-U+202E,
 *   U+2066-U+2069), and the invisible formatting characters U+00AD, U+200B and
 *   U+FEFF.
 *
 *   The reordering half is the load-bearing one, and it is a DIFFERENT claim
 *   from the residual this fold deliberately leaves standing. Injected words
 *   can still read as prose INSIDE the quotes, and that was accepted on two
 *   stated grounds: the quoted span stays visibly bounded, and this server's
 *   own consequence still lands last. An override is the one input for which
 *   both grounds are false. It applies to the rest of the paragraph, so what
 *   it reverses is the closing delimiter and the consequence clause
 *   THEMSELVES. A title that is U+202E followed by a reversed sentence renders
 *   forwards as a reassurance nobody here wrote, with this server's own words
 *   garbled after it. Keeping the accepted residual acceptable therefore
 *   REQUIRES dropping these: they are what would unbound the span the
 *   acceptance rests on.
 *
 *   The invisible half earns its place on a smaller argument, said plainly
 *   because the next reader will weigh it: no attack is known through it. What
 *   it closes is that a character rendering nothing makes what the user reads

 * - **The delimiter cannot appear inside the delimiter.** An ASCII `'` becomes
 *   U+2019, which reads the same to a person and closes nothing.
 *
 * Then a cap, because a title the length of a paragraph buries the consequence

 * **The property that matters: the sentence the user reads is written by this

 * transcript.** The confirmation token is strong on the mechanics — user-bound,
 * etag-bound, change-hashed, single-use — and guarantees nothing at all about
 * what somebody was told before they agreed. This is the half that addresses
 * that (PITFALLS #40).
 *
 * The ways the obvious implementation fails, in the register `changeHashOf`'s
 * docstring sets:
 *
 * - **Five call sites each phrasing their own line is five chances to drift
 *   apart**, and the drift is invisible until somebody reads two transcripts
 *   side by side. That is why this is one function rather than a helper each
 *   tool owns, and why a count constraint in `scripts/forbidden-tokens.mjs`
 *   holds it at exactly one definition site — zero as much a violation as two.
 * - **The commit line is the SAME composer with a different tense**, not a
 *   second function that happens to agree today. A preview line and a commit
 *   line that cannot structurally disagree is a stronger guarantee than two
 *   that do.
 * - **It is not a guarantee, and saying so is part of the guarantee.** The model
 *   can still paraphrase, and nothing here can stop it. What this buys is that
 *   divergence is VISIBLE, which is the same standard the recipient-naming
 *   requirement already sets — and claiming more would leave a reader
 *   over-trusting this layer.
 * - **Counts and names are the load-bearing part, not decoration.** A line
 *   saying "deleting a calendar" is one a misleading summary can be written
 *   over; a line naming the calendar and the nine events going with it is not.
 *   Which is why every count reaching here has to have come off the caller's own
 *   walk rather than off the request.
 * - **The name is stranger-authored and the sentence is the server's, so the
 *   name is folded before it is embedded.** See `quotedName`. Raw interpolation
 *   let a third party's event title close its own quote and write a clause into
 *   a sentence the model is instructed to relay word for word. The reported
 *   fields beside this line are unaffected and stay byte-exact.
 *
 * It throws nothing and refuses nothing. PITFALLS #40 is explicit that there is
 * nothing to refuse — a response-shape requirement is satisfied by the shape
 * being there, and a refusal invented for it would turn a missing sentence into

 * ETag would satisfy the object arm, and the whole point of `b` is that a
 * collection target cannot be committed as an object one.
 *
 * `g` is REQUIRED, and a payload from a build that predates it is refused here
 * rather than admitted with the field reading `undefined`. That is
 * `hasDavObjectArm`'s `"s" in candidate` argument in its sharper form: an
 * absent count does not read as "the collection held none", it reaches the
 * refusal's own sentence as a number nobody observed. The token is five minutes
 * old at most, so refusing costs one re-preview.
